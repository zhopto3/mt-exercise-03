For what ?
CAMILLO .
He thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , As he had seen ’ t or been an instrument To vice you to ’ t , that you have touch ’ d his queen <unk> .
POLIXENES .
O , then my best blood turn To an infected <unk> , and my name Be <unk> ’ d with his that did betray the <unk> !
Turn then my <unk> reputation to A <unk> that may strike the <unk> <unk> Where I <unk> , and my approach be <unk> ’ d , Nay , hated too , worse than the great ’ st infection That e ’ er was heard or read !
CAMILLO .
Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their <unk> , you may as well <unk> the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The <unk> of his folly , whose <unk> Is <unk> ’ d upon his faith , and will continue The standing of his body .
POLIXENES .
How should this grow ?
CAMILLO .
I know not : but I am sure ’ tis <unk> to <unk> what ’ s grown than question how ’ tis born .
If therefore you dare trust my honesty , That lies <unk> in this trunk , which you Shall bear along <unk> ’ d , away tonight .
Your followers I will whisper to the business , And will by <unk> and <unk> , at several <unk> , <unk> them o ’ th ’ city .
For myself , I ’ ll put My fortunes to your service , which are here By this <unk> lost .
Be not <unk> , For , by the honour of my parents , I Have utter ’ d truth : which if you seek to prove , I dare not stand by ; nor shall you be <unk> Than one condemned by the king ’ s own mouth , <unk> his execution sworn .
POLIXENES .
I do believe thee .
I saw his heart in ’ s face .
Give me thy hand , Be <unk> to me , and thy places shall Still neighbour mine .
My ships are ready , and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago .
This jealousy Is for a precious creature : as she ’ s rare , Must it be great ; and , as his person ’ s mighty , Must it be violent ; and as he does conceive He is dishonour ’ d by a man which ever <unk> ’ d to him , why , his <unk> must In that be made more bitter .
Fear o ’ <unk> me .
Good expedition be my friend , and comfort The gracious queen , part of his theme , but nothing Of his <unk> ’ en suspicion !
Come , Camillo , I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear ’ st my life off hence .
Let us avoid .

You ’ ll kiss me hard , and speak to me as if I were a baby still .
I love you better .
SECOND LADY .
And why so , my lord ?

Not for because Your brows are <unk> ; yet black brows , they say , <unk> some women best , so that there be not Too much hair there , but in a <unk> Or a <unk> made with a pen .
SECOND LADY .
Who taught this ?

I learn ’ d it out of women ’ s faces .
Pray now , What colour are your <unk> ?

LEONTES .
How blest am I In my just censure , in my true opinion !
Alack , for lesser knowledge !
How <unk> ’ d In being so blest !
There may be in the cup A <unk> steep ’ d , and one may drink , depart , And yet <unk> no venom , for his knowledge Is not infected ; but if one present Th ’ <unk> ’ d <unk> to his eye , make known How he hath drunk , he <unk> his <unk> , his sides , With violent <unk> .
I have drunk , and seen the <unk> .
Camillo was his help in this , his <unk> .
There is a plot against my life , my crown ; All ’ s true that is <unk> .
That false villain Whom I employ ’ d , was <unk> ’ d by him .
He has discover ’ d my design , and I <unk> a pinch ’ d thing ; yea , a very trick For them to play at will .

Though he does bear some signs of me , yet you Have too much blood in him .
HERMIONE .
What is this ?

LEONTES .
Bear the boy hence , he shall not come about her , Away with him , and let her sport herself With that she ’ s big with ; for ’ tis Polixenes Has made thee swell thus .

LEONTES .
You , my lords , Look on her , mark her well .
Be but about To say , “ she is a goodly lady , ” and The justice of your hearts will thereto add “ ’ Tis pity she ’ s not honest , honourable ” : <unk> her but for this her <unk> form , Which on my faith deserves high speech , and straight The <unk> , the <unk> or ha , these petty <unk> That <unk> doth use — O , I am out , That mercy does ; for <unk> will <unk> Virtue itself — these <unk> , these <unk> ’ s , and ha ’ s , When you have said “ she ’ s goodly , ” come between , Ere you can say “ she ’ s honest ” : but be it known , From him that has most cause to grieve it should be , She ’ s an <unk> !
HERMIONE .
Should a villain say so , The most <unk> ’ d villain in the world , He were as much more villain : you , my lord , Do but mistake .
LEONTES .
You have mistook , my lady , Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing , Which I ’ ll not call a creature of thy place , Lest <unk> , making me the precedent , Should a like language use to all degrees , And <unk> <unk> leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar .
I have said She ’ s an <unk> ; I have said with whom : More , she ’ s a traitor , and Camillo is A <unk> with her ; and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile <unk> , that she ’ s A <unk> , even as bad as those That <unk> give bold ’ st titles ; ay , and <unk> To this their late escape .

No , by my life , <unk> to none of this .
How will this grieve you , When you shall come to <unk> knowledge , that You thus have <unk> ’ d me !
Gentle my lord , You scarce can right me <unk> then , to say You did mistake .
LEONTES .
No .
If I mistake In those <unk> which I build upon , The <unk> is not big enough to bear A <unk> ’ s top .
Away with her to prison !
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty But that he speaks .
HERMIONE .
There ’ s some ill <unk> <unk> : I must be patient till the heavens look With an aspect more <unk> .
Good my lords , I am not <unk> to weeping , as our sex <unk> are ; the want of which vain dew Perchance shall dry your <unk> .
But I have That honourable grief <unk> ’ d here which burns <unk> than tears drown : beseech you all , my lords , With thoughts so <unk> as your <unk> Shall best instruct you , measure me ; and so The king ’ s will be perform ’ d .

ANTIGONUS .
If it prove She ’ s otherwise , I ’ ll keep my <unk> where I lodge my wife ; I ’ ll go in <unk> with her ; Than when I feel and see her no further trust her .
For every inch of woman in the world , Ay , every dram of woman ’ s flesh , is false , If she be .
LEONTES .
Hold your <unk> .
FIRST LORD .
Good my lord , — ANTIGONUS .
It is for you we speak , not for ourselves : You are abus ’ d , and by some <unk> That will be damn ’ d for ’ t : would I knew the villain , I would <unk> him .
Be she <unk> ’ d , I have three daughters ; the eldest is eleven ; The second and the third , nine and some five ; If this prove true , they ’ ll pay for ’ t .
By mine honour , I ’ ll <unk> ’ em all ; fourteen they shall not see , To bring false <unk> : they are <unk> , And I had rather <unk> myself than they Should not <unk> fair issue .
LEONTES .
<unk> ; no more .
You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man ’ s nose : but I do see ’ t and feel ’ t , As you feel doing thus ; and see withal The instruments that feel .
ANTIGONUS .
If it be so , We need no grave to bury honesty .
There ’ s not a grain of it the face to <unk> Of the whole <unk> earth .
LEONTES .
What !

FIRST LORD .
I had rather you did lack than I , my lord , Upon this ground : and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion , Be <unk> ’ d for ’ t how you might .
LEONTES .
Why , what need we <unk> with you of this , but rather follow Our <unk> <unk> ?
Our <unk> <unk> not your counsels , but our natural goodness <unk> this ; which , if you , or <unk> Or seeming so in skill , cannot or will not <unk> a truth , like us , inform yourselves We need no more of your advice : the matter , The loss , the gain , the <unk> ’ ring on ’ t , is all <unk> ours .
ANTIGONUS .
And I wish , my liege , You had only in your silent judgement tried it , Without more <unk> .
LEONTES .
How could that be ?
Either thou art most ignorant by age , Or thou wert born a fool .
Camillo ’ s flight , <unk> to their <unk> , ( Which was as gross as ever touch ’ d <unk> , That lack ’ d sight only , nought for <unk> But only seeing , all other <unk> Made up to th ’ deed ) doth push on this proceeding .
Yet , for a greater <unk> ( For in an act of this <unk> , ’ twere Most piteous to be wild ) , I have dispatch ’ d in post To sacred <unk> , to Apollo ’ s temple , <unk> and <unk> , whom you know Of stuff ’ d <unk> : now from the oracle They will bring all , whose <unk> counsel had , Shall stop or spur me .
Have I done well ?
FIRST LORD .
Well done , my lord .
LEONTES .
Though I am satisfied , and need no more Than what I know , yet shall the oracle Give rest to the minds of others , such as he Whose ignorant <unk> will not Come up to th ’ truth .
So have we thought it good From our free person she should be <unk> ’ d , Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform .
Come , follow us ; We are to speak in public ; for this business Will raise us all .

Away with her !

I pray you , do not push me ; I ’ ll be gone .
Look to your babe , my lord ; ’ tis yours : Jove send her A better <unk> spirit !

Hermione is brought in guarded ; Paulina and Ladies attending .
LEONTES .
Read the <unk> .
OFFICER .
&#91; _ Reads . _ &#93; “ Hermione , queen to the worthy Leontes , king of Sicilia , thou art here <unk> and <unk> of high treason , in <unk> <unk> with Polixenes , king of Bohemia ; and <unk> with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king , thy royal husband : the <unk> whereof being by <unk> partly laid open , thou , Hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for their better safety , to fly away by night . ” HERMIONE .
Since what I am to say must be but that Which <unk> my <unk> , and The <unk> on my part no other But what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me To say “ Not guilty ” .
Mine integrity , Being <unk> falsehood , shall , as I express it , Be so receiv ’ d .
But thus , if powers divine Behold our human actions , as they do , I doubt not , then , but innocence shall make False <unk> blush , and tyranny <unk> at patience .
You , my lord , best know , Who least will seem to do so , my past life Hath been as <unk> , as chaste , as true , As I am now unhappy ; which is more Than history can pattern , though <unk> ’ d And play ’ d to take <unk> .
For behold me , A fellow of the royal bed , which owe A moiety of the throne , a great king ’ s daughter , The mother to a <unk> prince , here standing To <unk> and talk for life and honour ’ fore Who please to come and hear .
For life , I prize it As I weigh grief , which I would spare .
For honour , ’ Tis a <unk> from me to mine , And only that I stand for .
I appeal To your own conscience , sir , before Polixenes Came to your court , how I was in your grace , How <unk> to be so ; since he came , With what encounter so <unk> I Have strain ’ d t ’ appear thus : if one jot beyond The bound of honour , or in act or will That way <unk> , <unk> ’ d be the hearts Of all that hear me , and my near ’ st of kin Cry fie upon my grave !
LEONTES .
I ne ’ er heard yet That any of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> what they did Than to perform it first .
HERMIONE .
That ’ s true enough ; Though ’ tis a saying , sir , not due to me .
LEONTES .
You will not own it .
HERMIONE .
More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault , I must not At all acknowledge .
For Polixenes , With whom I am <unk> ’ d , I do confess I lov ’ d him as in honour he <unk> ’ d , With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me ; with a love even such , So and no other , as yourself commanded : Which not to have done , I think had been in me Both <unk> and ingratitude To you and toward your friend , whose love had spoke , Ever since it could speak , from an infant , freely , That it was yours .
Now , for <unk> , I know not how it <unk> , though it be dish ’ d For me to try how : all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man ; And why he left your court , the gods themselves , <unk> no more than I , are ignorant .
LEONTES .
You knew of his departure , as you know What you have <unk> ’ en to do in ’ s absence .
HERMIONE .
Sir , You speak a language that I understand not : My life stands in the level of your dreams , Which I ’ ll lay down .
LEONTES .
Your actions are my dreams .
You had a bastard by Polixenes , And I but dream ’ d it .
As you were past all shame ( Those of your <unk> are so ) so past all truth , Which to deny concerns more than <unk> ; for as Thy <unk> hath been cast out , like to itself , No father <unk> it ( which is , indeed , More <unk> in thee than it ) , so thou <unk> feel our justice ; in whose <unk> passage Look for no less than death .
HERMIONE .
Sir , spare your <unk> : The <unk> which you would fright me with , I seek .
To me can life be no commodity .
The crown and comfort of my life , your favour , I do give lost , for I do feel it gone , But know not how it went .
My second joy , And <unk> of my body , from his presence I am <unk> ’ d , like one <unk> .
My third comfort , <unk> ’ d most <unk> , is from my breast , ( The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth ) Hal ’ d out to murder ; myself on every post <unk> ’ d a strumpet ; with <unk> hatred The <unk> privilege denied , which ’ longs To women of all fashion ; <unk> , <unk> Here to this place , i ’ th ’ open air , before I have got strength of limit .
Now , my liege , Tell me what blessings I have here alive , That I should fear to die .
Therefore proceed .
But yet hear this : mistake me not : no life , I prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , Which I would free , if I shall be condemn ’ d Upon <unk> , all <unk> sleeping else But what your <unk> awake I tell you ’ Tis <unk> , and not law .
Your honours all , I do <unk> me to the oracle : Apollo be my judge !
FIRST LORD .
This your request Is altogether just : therefore bring forth , And in Apollo ’ s name , his oracle : &#91; _ Exeunt certain Officers . _ &#93; HERMIONE .

I ’ ll <unk> me to Polixenes , <unk> woo my queen , <unk> the good Camillo , Whom I proclaim a man of truth , of mercy ; For , being <unk> by my <unk> To bloody thoughts and to revenge , I chose Camillo for the minister to poison My friend Polixenes : which had been done , But that the good mind of Camillo <unk> My swift command , though I with death and with <unk> did threaten and <unk> him , Not doing it and being done .

But , O thou tyrant !
Do not repent these things , for they are <unk> Than all thy woes can stir .
Therefore <unk> thee To nothing but despair .

Alas , I have show ’ d too much The <unk> of a woman : he is touch ’ d To th ’ noble heart .

Do not receive affliction At my petition ; I beseech you , rather Let me be punish ’ d , that have <unk> you Of what you should forget .
Now , good my liege , Sir , royal sir , forgive a foolish woman : The love I bore your queen — lo , fool again !
I ’ ll speak of her no more , nor of your children .
I ’ ll not remember you of my own lord , Who is lost too .
Take your patience to you , And I ’ ll say nothing .
LEONTES .
Thou didst speak but well When most the truth , which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee .
Prithee , bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son : One grave shall be for both .
Upon them shall The <unk> of their death appear , unto Our shame perpetual .
Once a day I ’ ll visit The <unk> where they lie , and tears shed there Shall be my <unk> .

Ay , my lord , and fear We have <unk> in ill time : the <unk> look <unk> , And threaten present <unk> .
In my conscience , The heavens with that we have in hand are angry , And frown upon ’ s .
ANTIGONUS .
Their sacred wills be done !
Go , get aboard ; Look to thy bark : I ’ ll not be long before I call upon thee .

Make your best haste , and go not Too far i ’ th ’ land : ’ tis like to be loud weather ; Besides , this place is famous for the creatures Of prey that keep upon ’ t .

Come , poor babe .
I have heard , but not <unk> ’ d , the spirits of the dead May walk again : if such thing be , thy mother Appear ’ d to me last night ; for ne ’ er was dream So like a waking .
To me comes a creature , Sometimes her head on one side , some another .
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow , So fill ’ d and so <unk> : in pure white robes , Like very <unk> , she did approach My <unk> where I lay : thrice bow ’ d before me , And , <unk> to begin some speech , her eyes <unk> two <unk> .
The fury spent , anon Did this break from her : “ Good <unk> , Since fate , against thy better disposition , Hath made thy person for the <unk> Of my poor babe , according to thine oath , <unk> <unk> enough are in Bohemia , There weep , and leave it crying .
And , for the babe Is <unk> lost for ever , Perdita I prithee call ’ t .
For this <unk> business , Put on thee by my lord , thou ne ’ er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more . ” And so , with <unk> , She <unk> into air .

There lie ; and there thy character : there these ; &#91; _ <unk> down the child and a <unk> . _ &#93; Which may if fortune please , both breed thee , pretty , And still rest thine .

Farewell !
The day frowns more and more .

SHEPHERD .
I would there were no age between ten and <unk> , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but <unk> wenches with child , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , fighting — Hark you now !
Would any but these <unk> brains of <unk> and <unk> hunt this weather ?
They have <unk> away two of my best sheep , which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master : if <unk> I have them , ’ tis by the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> .
Good luck , an ’ t be thy will , what have we here ?
&#91; _ <unk> up the child . _ &#93; <unk> on ’ s , a <unk> !
A very pretty <unk> !
A boy or a child , I wonder ?
A pretty one ; a very pretty one .
Sure , some scape .
Though I am not <unk> , yet I can read <unk> in the scape .
This has been some <unk> , some <unk> , some <unk> .

If thou ’ lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten , come hither .
What <unk> ’ st thou , man ?
CLOWN .
I have seen two such sights , by sea and by land !
But I am not to say it is a sea , for it is now the sky : betwixt the <unk> and it , you cannot thrust a <unk> ’ s point .
SHEPHERD .
Why , boy , how is it ?
CLOWN .
I would you did but see how it <unk> , how it <unk> , how it takes up the shore !
But that ’ s not to the point .
O , the most piteous cry of the poor souls !
sometimes to see ’ em , and not to see ’ em .
Now the ship <unk> the moon with her <unk> , and anon <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , as you ’ d thrust a <unk> into a <unk> .
And then for the land service , to see how the bear <unk> out his <unk> , how he cried to me for help , and said his name was <unk> , a <unk> .
But to make an end of the ship , to see how the sea <unk> ’ d it : but first , how the poor souls <unk> , and the sea <unk> them , and how the poor gentleman <unk> , and the bear <unk> him , both roaring <unk> than the sea or weather .
SHEPHERD .
<unk> of mercy , when was this , boy ?
CLOWN .
Now , now .
I have not <unk> since I saw these sights : the men are not yet cold under water , nor the bear half <unk> on the gentleman .
He ’ s at it now .
SHEPHERD .
Would I had been by to have <unk> the old man !
CLOWN .
I would you had been by the ship side , to have <unk> her : there your charity would have <unk> footing .
SHEPHERD .

But look thee here , boy .
Now bless thyself : thou met ’ st with things dying , I with things <unk> .
Here ’ s a sight for thee .
Look thee , a <unk> for a <unk> ’ s child !
Look thee here ; take up , take up , boy ; open ’ t .
So , let ’ s see .
It was told me I should be rich by the fairies .
This is some <unk> : open ’ t .
What ’ s within , boy ?
CLOWN .
You ’ re a made old man .
If the sins of your youth are <unk> you , you ’ re well to live .

all gold !
SHEPHERD .
This is fairy gold , boy , and ’ twill prove so .
Up with it , keep it close : home , home , the next way .
We are <unk> , boy , and to be so still <unk> nothing but <unk> .
Let my sheep go : come , good boy , the next way home .
CLOWN .
Go you the next way with your <unk> .
I ’ ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman , and how much he hath eaten .
They are never curst but when they are hungry : if there be any of him left , I ’ ll bury it .
SHEPHERD .
That ’ s a good deed .
If thou <unk> <unk> by that which is left of him what he is , fetch me to th ’ sight of him .
CLOWN .
Marry , will I ; and you shall help to put him i ’ th ’ ground .

I that please some , try all : both joy and terror Of good and bad , that makes and <unk> error , Now take upon me , in the name of Time , To use my wings .
<unk> it not a crime To me or my swift passage , that I <unk> O ’ er <unk> years , and leave the growth <unk> Of that wide <unk> , since it is in my power To o ’ <unk> law , and in one <unk> hour To plant and o ’ <unk> custom .
Let me pass The same I am , ere ancient ’ st order was Or what is now received .
I witness to The times that brought them in ; so shall I do To th ’ <unk> things now <unk> , and make stale The <unk> of this present , as my tale Now seems to it .
Your patience this <unk> , I turn my glass , and give my scene such growing As you had slept between .
Leontes <unk> Th ’ effects of his fond <unk> , so <unk> That he <unk> up himself , imagine me , Gentle <unk> , that I now may be In fair Bohemia , and remember well , I <unk> a son o ’ th ’ king ’ s , which <unk> I now name to you ; and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita , now grown in grace <unk> with <unk> .
What of her <unk> I list not prophesy ; but let Time ’ s news Be known when ’ tis brought forth .
A shepherd ’ s daughter , And what to her <unk> , which follows after , Is th ’ argument of Time .
Of this allow , If ever you have spent time worse ere now ; If never , yet that Time himself doth say He wishes <unk> you never may .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; SCENE II .
Bohemia .
A Room in the palace of Polixenes .
Enter Polixenes and Camillo .
POLIXENES .
I pray thee , good Camillo , be no more <unk> : ’ tis a sickness <unk> thee anything ; a death to grant this .
CAMILLO .
It is fifteen years since I saw my country .
Though I have for the most part been <unk> abroad , I desire to lay my bones there .
Besides , the <unk> king , my master , hath sent for me ; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some <unk> , or I o ’ <unk> to think so , — which is another spur to my departure .
POLIXENES .
As thou lov ’ st me , Camillo , wipe not out the rest of thy services by <unk> me now : the need I have of thee , thine own goodness hath made ; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee .
Thou , having made me <unk> which none without thee can <unk> manage , must either stay to execute them thyself , or take away with thee the very services thou hast done , which if I have not enough <unk> ( as too much I cannot ) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study ; and my profit therein the <unk> <unk> .
Of that fatal country Sicilia , prithee speak no more ; whose very <unk> <unk> me with the remembrance of that <unk> , as thou call ’ st him , and <unk> king , my brother ; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be <unk> <unk> .
Say to me , when <unk> thou the Prince <unk> , my son ?
Kings are no less unhappy , their issue not being gracious , than they are in losing them when they have <unk> their virtues .
CAMILLO .
Sir , it is three days since I saw the prince .
What his happier affairs may be , are to me unknown , but I have <unk> noted he is of late much <unk> from court , and is less <unk> to his princely <unk> than <unk> he hath <unk> .
POLIXENES .
I have <unk> so much , Camillo , and with some care ; so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his <unk> ; from whom I have this intelligence , that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd , a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an <unk> estate .
CAMILLO .
I have heard , sir , of such a man , who hath a daughter of most rare note : the report of her is <unk> more than can be thought to begin from such a <unk> .
POLIXENES .
That ’ s likewise part of my intelligence : but , I fear , the <unk> that <unk> our son thither .
Thou shalt <unk> us to the place , where we will , not <unk> what we are , have some question with the shepherd ; from whose <unk> I think it not <unk> to get the cause of my son ’ s resort thither .
Prithee , be my present partner in this business , and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia .
CAMILLO .
I willingly obey your command .
POLIXENES .

“ Three pound of sugar , five pound of <unk> , <unk> ” — what will this sister of mine do with <unk> ?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it on .
She hath made me <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , <unk> <unk> all , and very good ones ; but they are most of them means and <unk> , but one <unk> amongst them , and he sings <unk> to <unk> .

No , good sweet sir ; no , I beseech you , sir : I have a kinsman not past <unk> of a mile hence , unto whom I was going .
I shall there have money or anything I want .
<unk> me no money , I pray you ; that kills my heart .
CLOWN .
What manner of fellow was he that <unk> you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
A fellow , sir , that I have known to go about with <unk> .
I knew him once a servant of the prince ; I cannot tell , good sir , for which of his virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court .
CLOWN .
His <unk> , you would say ; there ’ s no virtue whipped out of the court .
They cherish it to make it stay there ; and yet it will no more but abide .
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> , I would say , sir .
I know this man well .
He hath been since an <unk> , then a <unk> , a <unk> .
Then he <unk> a motion of the <unk> Son , and married a <unk> ’ s wife within a mile where my land and living lies ; and , having <unk> over many <unk> <unk> , he settled only in rogue .

Not a more <unk> rogue in all Bohemia .
If you had but looked big and spit at him , he ’ d have run .
AUTOLYCUS .
I must confess to you , sir , I am no <unk> .
I am false of heart that way ; and that he knew , I warrant him .

Sweet sir , much better than I was .

A <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Enter <unk> and Perdita .
FLORIZEL .
These your <unk> weeds to each part of you Do give a life , no <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in April ’ s front .
This your <unk> Is as a meeting of the petty gods , And you the queen on ’ t .
PERDITA .
Sir , my gracious lord , To chide at your extremes it not becomes me ; O , pardon that I name them !
Your high self , The gracious mark o ’ th ’ land , you have <unk> ’ d With a swain ’ s wearing , and me , poor <unk> maid , Most <unk> <unk> ’ d up .
But that our feasts In every <unk> have folly , and the <unk> <unk> it with a custom , I should blush To see you so <unk> ’ d ; <unk> , I think , To show myself a glass .
FLORIZEL .
I bless the time When my good <unk> made her flight <unk> Thy father ’ s ground .
PERDITA .
Now Jove afford you cause !
To me the difference <unk> dread .
Your greatness Hath not been us ’ d to fear .
Even now I tremble To think your father , by some accident , Should pass this way , as you did .
O , the <unk> !
How would he look to see his work , so noble , <unk> bound up ?
What would he say ?
Or how Should I , in these my borrow ’ d <unk> , behold The <unk> of his presence ?
FLORIZEL .
<unk> Nothing but <unk> .
The gods themselves , <unk> their <unk> to love , have taken The shapes of beasts upon them .
Jupiter <unk> a bull and <unk> ’ d ; the green Neptune A <unk> and <unk> ; and the <unk> ’ d god , <unk> Apollo , a poor humble swain , As I seem now .
Their <unk> Were never for a piece of beauty <unk> , Nor in a way so chaste , since my desires Run not before mine honour , nor my <unk> <unk> <unk> than my faith .
PERDITA .
O , but , sir , Your resolution cannot hold when ’ tis <unk> ’ d , as it must be , by the power of the king : One of these two must be <unk> , Which then will speak , that you must change this purpose , Or I my life .
FLORIZEL .
Thou dearest Perdita , With these forc ’ d thoughts , I prithee , <unk> not The mirth o ’ th ’ feast .
Or I ’ ll be thine , my fair , Or not my father ’ s .
For I cannot be Mine own , nor anything to any , if I be not thine .
To this I am most constant , Though destiny say no .
Be merry , gentle .
<unk> such thoughts as these with anything That you behold the while .
Your guests are coming : <unk> up your countenance , as it were the day Of <unk> of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come .
PERDITA .
O lady Fortune , Stand you <unk> !
FLORIZEL .
See , your guests approach : <unk> yourself to entertain them <unk> , And let ’ s be red with mirth .
Enter <unk> with Polixenes and Camillo , disguised ; Clown , <unk> , <unk> with others .
SHEPHERD .
Fie , daughter !
When my old wife liv ’ d , upon This day she was both <unk> , <unk> , cook , Both dame and servant ; <unk> ’ d all ; serv ’ d all ; Would sing her song and dance her turn ; now here At <unk> end o ’ th ’ table , now i ’ th ’ middle ; On his shoulder , and his ; her face o ’ fire With labour , and the thing she took to quench it She would to each one <unk> .
You are <unk> , As if you were a <unk> one , and not The hostess of the meeting : pray you , bid These unknown friends to ’ s welcome , for it is A way to make us better friends , more known .
Come , quench your <unk> , and present yourself That which you are , mistress o ’ th ’ feast .
Come on , And bid us welcome to your <unk> , As your good flock shall prosper .
PERDITA .
&#91; _ To Polixenes . _ &#93; Sir , welcome .
It is my father ’ s will I should take on me The <unk> o ’ the day .
&#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; You ’ re welcome , sir .
Give me those flowers there , <unk> .
<unk> sirs , For you there ’ s <unk> and rue ; these keep <unk> and <unk> all the winter long .
Grace and remembrance be to you both !
And welcome to our <unk> !
POLIXENES .
<unk> — A fair one are you — well you fit our <unk> With flowers of winter .
PERDITA .
Sir , the year growing ancient , Not yet on summer ’ s death nor on the birth Of trembling winter , the fairest flowers o ’ th ’ season Are our <unk> and <unk> ’ d <unk> , Which some call nature ’ s <unk> : of that kind Our <unk> garden ’ s barren ; and I care not To get <unk> of them .
POLIXENES .
Wherefore , gentle maiden , Do you neglect them ?
PERDITA .
For I have heard it said There is an art which , in their <unk> , <unk> With great <unk> nature .
POLIXENES .
Say there be ; Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean .
So , over that art Which you say <unk> to nature , is an art That nature makes .
You see , sweet maid , we marry A <unk> <unk> to the <unk> stock , And make conceive a bark of <unk> kind By bud of nobler race .
This is an art Which does mend nature , change it rather , but The art itself is nature .
PERDITA .
So it is .
POLIXENES .
Then make your garden rich in <unk> , And do not call them <unk> .
PERDITA .
I ’ ll not put The <unk> in earth to set one slip of them ; No more than , were I painted , I would wish This youth should say ’ twere well , and only therefore <unk> to breed by me .
Here ’ s flowers for you : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , The <unk> , that goes to bed with th ’ sun And with him rises weeping .
These are flowers Of middle summer , and I think they are given To men of middle age .
You ’ re very welcome .
CAMILLO .
I should leave <unk> , were I of your flock , And only live by gazing .
PERDITA .
Out , alas !
You ’ d be so lean that <unk> of <unk> Would blow you through and through .
&#91; _ To <unk> _ &#93; Now , my fair ’ st friend , I would I had some flowers o ’ th ’ spring , that might <unk> your time of day ; and yours , and yours , That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your <unk> growing .
O <unk> , From the flowers now that , <unk> , thou let ’ st fall From <unk> ’ s <unk> !
<unk> , That come before the swallow dares , and take The winds of March with beauty ; <unk> dim , But sweeter than the <unk> of Juno ’ s eyes Or <unk> ’ s breath ; pale <unk> , That die <unk> ere they can behold <unk> <unk> in his strength ( a <unk> Most <unk> to maids ) ; bold <unk> and The crown imperial ; <unk> of all <unk> , The <unk> being one .
O , these I lack , To make you <unk> of ; and my sweet friend , To strew him o ’ er and o ’ er !
FLORIZEL .
What , like a corse ?
PERDITA .
No , like a bank for love to lie and play on ; Not like a corse ; or if , not to be buried , But quick , and in mine arms .
Come , take your flowers .
Methinks I play as I have seen them do In <unk> <unk> .
Sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition .
FLORIZEL .
What you do Still <unk> what is done .
When you speak , sweet , I ’ d have you do it ever .
When you sing , I ’ d have you buy and sell so , so give <unk> , Pray so ; and , for the <unk> ’ ring your affairs , To sing them too .
When you do dance , I wish you A <unk> o ’ th ’ sea , that you might ever do Nothing but that , move still , still so , And own no other function .
Each your doing , So <unk> in each particular , <unk> what you are doing in the present deeds , That all your acts are <unk> .
PERDITA .
O <unk> , Your praises are too large .
But that your youth , And the true blood which <unk> fairly through ’ t , Do plainly give you out an <unk> shepherd , With wisdom I might fear , my <unk> , You woo ’ d me the false way .
FLORIZEL .
I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to ’ t .
But , come ; our dance , I pray .
Your hand , my Perdita .
So <unk> pair That never mean to part .
PERDITA .
I ’ ll swear for ’ em .
POLIXENES .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> that ever <unk> on the <unk> .
Nothing she does or seems But <unk> of something greater than herself , Too noble for this place .
CAMILLO .
He tells her something That makes her blood look out .
Good sooth , she is The queen of <unk> and <unk> .
CLOWN .
Come on , strike up .
<unk> .
<unk> must be your mistress : marry , <unk> , to mend her kissing with !
<unk> .
Now , in good time !
CLOWN .
Not a word , a word ; we stand upon our manners .
Come , strike up .
&#91; _ Music .
Here a dance Of <unk> and <unk> . _ &#93; POLIXENES .
Pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this Which <unk> with your daughter ?
SHEPHERD .
They call him <unk> ; and <unk> himself To have a worthy feeding .
But I have it Upon his own report , and I believe it .
He looks like sooth .
He says he loves my daughter .
I think so too ; for never <unk> ’ d the moon Upon the water as he ’ ll stand and read , As ’ twere , my daughter ’ s eyes .
And , to be plain , I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best .
POLIXENES .
She <unk> <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
So she does anything , though I report it That should be silent .
If young <unk> Do light upon her , she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of .
Enter a Servant .
SERVANT .
O master , if you did but hear the <unk> at the door , you would never dance again after a <unk> and <unk> ; no , the <unk> could not move you .
He sings several <unk> faster than you ’ ll tell money .
He <unk> them as he had eaten <unk> , and all men ’ s ears grew to his <unk> .
CLOWN .
He could never come better : he shall come in .
I love a <unk> but even too well , if it be <unk> matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung <unk> .
SERVANT .
He hath songs for man or woman of all <unk> .
No <unk> can so fit his <unk> with gloves .
He has the <unk> <unk> for maids , so without <unk> , which is strange ; with such delicate <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , “ <unk> her and <unk> her ” ; and where some <unk> rascal would , as it were , mean mischief and break a foul <unk> into the matter , he makes the maid to answer “ <unk> , do me no harm , good man ” ; puts him off , <unk> him , with “ <unk> , do me no harm , good man . ” POLIXENES .
This is a brave fellow .
CLOWN .
Believe me , thou <unk> of an <unk> <unk> fellow .
Has he any <unk> <unk> ?
SERVANT .
He hath <unk> of all the colours i ’ th ’ <unk> ; points , more than all the <unk> in Bohemia can <unk> <unk> , though they come to him by th ’ gross ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; why he sings ’ em over as they were gods or <unk> ; you would think a <unk> were a <unk> , he so <unk> to the <unk> and the work about the square on ’ t .
CLOWN .
Prithee bring him in ; and let him approach singing .
PERDITA .
<unk> him that he use no <unk> words in ’ s <unk> .
&#91; _ Exit Servant . _ &#93; CLOWN .
You have of these <unk> that have more in them than you ’ d think , sister .
PERDITA .
Ay , good brother , or go about to think .
Enter <unk> , singing .
AUTOLYCUS .
_ <unk> as white as driven snow , <unk> black as e ’ er was crow , <unk> as sweet as <unk> roses , <unk> for faces and for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> for a lady ’ s chamber , <unk> <unk> and <unk> For my lads to give their <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of steel , What maids lack from head to heel .
Come buy of me , come ; come buy , come buy ; <unk> , lads , or else your <unk> cry .
Come , buy . _ CLOWN .
If I were not in love with <unk> , thou shouldst take no money of me ; but being <unk> as I am , it will also be the bondage of certain <unk> and gloves .
<unk> .
I was promised them against the feast ; but they come not too late now .
<unk> .
He hath promised you more than that , or there be <unk> .
<unk> .
He hath paid you all he promised you .
<unk> he has paid you more , which will shame you to give him again .
CLOWN .
Is there no manners left among maids ?
Will they wear their <unk> where they should bear their faces ?
Is there not <unk> , when you are going to bed , or <unk> , to <unk> of these secrets , but you must be <unk> before all our guests ?
’ Tis well they are <unk> .
<unk> your tongues , and not a word more .
<unk> .
I have done .
Come , you promised me a <unk> <unk> and a pair of sweet gloves .
CLOWN .
Have I not told thee how I was <unk> by the way and lost all my money ?
AUTOLYCUS .
And indeed , sir , there are <unk> abroad ; therefore it <unk> men to be <unk> .
CLOWN .
Fear not thou , man .
Thou shalt lose nothing here .
AUTOLYCUS .
I hope so , sir ; for I have about me many <unk> of charge .
CLOWN .
What hast here ?
<unk> ?
<unk> .
Pray now , buy some .
I love a <unk> in print <unk> , for then we are sure they are true .
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s one to a very <unk> tune .
How a <unk> ’ s wife was brought to bed of twenty <unk> at a burden , and how she <unk> to eat <unk> ’ heads and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
Is it true , think you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Very true , and but a month old .
<unk> .
Bless me from <unk> a <unk> !
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s the <unk> ’ s name to ’ t , one Mistress <unk> , and five or six honest wives that were present .
Why should I carry lies abroad ?
<unk> .
Pray you now , buy it .
CLOWN .
Come on , lay it by ; and let ’ s first see more <unk> .
We ’ ll buy the other things anon .
AUTOLYCUS .
Here ’ s another <unk> , of a fish that <unk> upon the coast on <unk> the <unk> of April , forty thousand <unk> above water , and sung this <unk> against the hard hearts of maids .
It was thought she was a woman , and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her .
The <unk> is very pitiful , and as true .
<unk> .
Is it true too , think you ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Five <unk> ’ hands at it , and <unk> more than my pack will hold .
CLOWN .
Lay it by too : another .
AUTOLYCUS .
This is a merry <unk> ; but a very pretty one .
<unk> .
Let ’ s have some merry ones .
AUTOLYCUS .
Why , this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of “ Two maids wooing a man . ” There ’ s scarce a maid <unk> but she sings it .
’ Tis in request , I can tell you .
<unk> .
We can both sing it : if thou ’ lt bear a part , thou shalt hear ; ’ tis in three parts .
<unk> .
We had the tune on ’ t a month ago .
AUTOLYCUS .
I can bear my part ; you must know ’ tis my <unk> : have at it with you .
<unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
_ Get you hence , for I must go Where it fits not you to know . _ <unk> .
_ Whither ? _ <unk> .
_ O , whither ? _ <unk> .
_ Whither ? _ <unk> .
_ It becomes thy oath full well Thou to me thy secrets tell . _ <unk> .
_ Me too !
Let me go thither . _ <unk> .
Or thou <unk> to th ’ <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> .
_ If to either , thou dost ill . _ AUTOLYCUS .
_ Neither . _ <unk> .
_ What , neither ? _ AUTOLYCUS .
_ Neither . _ <unk> .
_ Thou hast sworn my love to be . _ <unk> .
_ Thou hast sworn it more to me .
Then whither <unk> ?
Say , whither ? _ CLOWN .
We ’ ll have this song out anon by ourselves .
My father and the gentlemen are in sad talk , and we ’ ll not trouble them .
Come , bring away thy pack after me .
<unk> , I ’ ll buy for you both .
<unk> , let ’ s have the first choice .
Follow me , <unk> .
&#91; _ Exit with <unk> and <unk> . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; And you shall pay well for ’ em .
<unk> .
_ Will you buy any <unk> , Or <unk> for your <unk> , My dainty <unk> , my <unk> ?
<unk> silk , any thread , <unk> <unk> for your head , Of the new ’ st and <unk> ’ st , <unk> ’ st <unk> ?
Come to the <unk> ; <unk> ’ s a <unk> That doth utter all men ’ s <unk> . _ &#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; Enter Servant .
SERVANT .
Master , there is three <unk> , three <unk> , three <unk> , three <unk> , that have made themselves all men of hair .
They call themselves <unk> , and they have dance which the wenches say is a <unk> of <unk> , because they are not in ’ t ; but they themselves are o ’ the mind ( if it be not too rough for some that know little but <unk> ) it will please <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
Away !
we ’ ll none on ’ t .
Here has been too much homely <unk> already .
I know , sir , we weary you .
POLIXENES .
You weary those that <unk> us : pray , let ’ s see these four <unk> of <unk> .
SERVANT .
One three of them , by their own report , sir , hath <unk> before the king ; and not the worst of the three but <unk> twelve foot and a half by th ’ square .
SHEPHERD .
Leave your <unk> : since these good men are pleased , let them come in ; but quickly now .
SERVANT .
Why , they stay at door , sir .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; Enter <unk> <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
They dance , and then <unk> .
POLIXENES .
O , father , you ’ ll know more of that hereafter .
&#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; Is it not too far gone ?
’ Tis time to part them .
He ’ s simple and tells much .
&#91; _ To <unk> . _ &#93; How now , fair shepherd !
Your heart is full of something that does take Your mind from <unk> .
<unk> , when I was young And <unk> love , as you do , I was wont To load my she with <unk> : I would have <unk> ’ d The <unk> ’ s silken <unk> and have pour ’ d it To her <unk> .
You have let him go , And nothing <unk> with him .
If your <unk> <unk> should abuse , and call this Your lack of love or bounty , you were <unk> For a reply , at least if you make a care Of happy holding her .
FLORIZEL .
Old sir , I know She <unk> not such trifles as these are : The gifts she looks from me are pack ’ d and lock ’ d Up in my heart , which I have given already , But not deliver ’ d .
O , hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , Hath sometime lov ’ d .
I take thy hand !
this hand , As soft as dove ’ s down and as white as it , Or <unk> ’ s tooth , or the <unk> ’ d snow that ’ s <unk> By th ’ <unk> <unk> twice o ’ er .
POLIXENES .
What follows this ?
How <unk> the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before !
I have put you out .
But to your <unk> .
Let me hear What you profess .
FLORIZEL .
Do , and be witness to ’ t .
POLIXENES .
And this my neighbour , too ?
FLORIZEL .
And he , and more Than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all : That were I crown ’ d the most imperial monarch , <unk> most worthy , were I the fairest youth That ever made eye <unk> , had force and knowledge More than was ever man ’ s , I would not prize them Without her love ; for her employ them all ; Commend them and condemn them to her service , Or to their own <unk> .
POLIXENES .
<unk> offer ’ d .
CAMILLO .
This shows a sound affection .
SHEPHERD .
But my daughter , Say you the like to him ?
PERDITA .
I cannot speak So well , nothing so well ; no , nor mean better : By th ’ pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The <unk> of his .
SHEPHERD .
Take hands , a bargain !
And , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to ’ t .
I give my daughter to him , and will make Her <unk> equal his .
FLORIZEL .
O , that must be I ’ th ’ virtue of your daughter : one being dead , I shall have more than you can dream of yet ; Enough then for your wonder .
But come on , <unk> us ’ fore these <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
Come , your hand ; And , daughter , yours .
POLIXENES .
Soft , swain , awhile , beseech you ; Have you a father ?
FLORIZEL .
I have ; but what of him ?
POLIXENES .
<unk> he of this ?
FLORIZEL .
He neither does nor shall .
POLIXENES .
Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table .
Pray you once more , Is not your father grown <unk> Of reasonable affairs ?
is he not <unk> With age and <unk> ’ ring <unk> ?
can he speak ?
hear ?
Know man from man ?
<unk> his own estate ?
Lies he not <unk> ?
and again does nothing But what he did being <unk> ?
FLORIZEL .
No , good sir ; He has his health , and <unk> strength indeed Than most have of his age .
POLIXENES .
By my white beard , You offer him , if this be so , a wrong Something <unk> : reason my son Should choose himself a wife , but as good reason The father , all whose joy is nothing else But fair <unk> , should hold some counsel In such a business .
FLORIZEL .
I yield all this ; But for some other reasons , my grave sir , Which ’ tis not fit you know , I not acquaint My father of this business .
POLIXENES .
Let him know ’ t .
FLORIZEL .
He shall not .
POLIXENES .
Prithee let him .
FLORIZEL .
No , he must not .
SHEPHERD .
Let him , my son : he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice .
FLORIZEL .
Come , come , he must not .
Mark our contract .
POLIXENES .
&#91; _ <unk> himself . _ &#93; Mark your divorce , young sir , Whom son I dare not call ; thou art too base To be <unk> : thou a sceptre ’ s heir , That thus <unk> a <unk> !
Thou , old traitor , I am sorry that , by hanging thee , I can But <unk> thy life one week .
And thou , fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft , whom of force must know The royal fool thou <unk> ’ st with , — SHEPHERD .
O , my heart !
POLIXENES .
I ’ ll have thy beauty scratch ’ d with <unk> and made More homely than thy state .
For thee , fond boy , If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this <unk> ( as never I mean thou shalt ) , we ’ ll bar thee from succession ; Not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , <unk> than <unk> off .
Mark thou my words .
Follow us to the court .
Thou <unk> , for this time , Though full of our displeasure , yet we free thee From the dead blow of it .
And you , <unk> , Worthy enough a <unk> ; yea , him too That makes himself , but for our honour therein , <unk> thee .
If ever henceforth thou These <unk> <unk> to his entrance open , Or <unk> his body more with thy <unk> , I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to ’ t .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; PERDITA .
Even here undone .
I was not much afeard , for once or twice I was about to speak , and tell him plainly The <unk> sun that shines upon his court <unk> not his visage from our <unk> , but <unk> on alike .
&#91; _ To <unk> . _ &#93; Will ’ t please you , sir , be gone ?
I told you what would come of this .
Beseech you , Of your own state take care .
This dream of mine — Being now awake , I ’ ll queen it no inch farther , But milk my <unk> , and weep .
CAMILLO .
Why , how now , father !
Speak ere thou diest .
SHEPHERD .
I cannot speak , nor think , Nor dare to know that which I know .
O sir , You have undone a man of <unk> three , That thought to fill his grave in quiet ; yea , To die upon the bed my father died , To lie close by his honest bones ; but now Some hangman must put on my <unk> and lay me Where no priest <unk> in dust .
O cursed wretch , That knew ’ st this was the prince , and wouldst adventure To <unk> faith with him !
<unk> , undone !
If I might die within this hour , I have liv ’ d To die when I desire .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; FLORIZEL .
Why look you so upon me ?
I am but sorry , not afeard ; delay ’ d , But nothing <unk> ’ red : what I was , I am : More <unk> on for <unk> back ; not following My <unk> <unk> .
CAMILLO .
<unk> my lord , You know your father ’ s temper : at this time He will allow no speech ( which I do guess You do not purpose to him ) and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet , I fear : Then , till the fury of his highness <unk> , Come not before him .
FLORIZEL .
I not purpose it .
I think Camillo ?
CAMILLO .
Even he , my lord .
PERDITA .
How often have I told you ’ <unk> be thus !
How often said my dignity would last But till ’ twere known !
FLORIZEL .
It cannot fail but by The <unk> of my faith ; and then Let nature <unk> the sides o ’ th ’ earth together And mar the <unk> within !
<unk> up thy looks .
From my succession wipe me , father ; I Am heir to my affection .
CAMILLO .
Be advis ’ d .
FLORIZEL .
I am , and by my fancy .
If my reason Will thereto be obedient , I have reason ; If not , my senses , better pleas ’ d with madness , Do bid it welcome .
CAMILLO .
This is desperate , sir .
FLORIZEL .
So call it : but it does <unk> my vow .
I needs must think it honesty .
Camillo , Not for Bohemia , nor the pomp that may Be <unk> <unk> ’ d ; for all the sun sees or The close earth <unk> , or the profound seas hides In unknown <unk> , will I break my oath To this my fair belov ’ d .
Therefore , I pray you , As you have ever been my father ’ s honour ’ d friend , When he shall miss me , — as , in faith , I mean not To see him any more , — cast your good counsels Upon his passion : let myself and fortune <unk> for the time to come .
This you may know , And so deliver , I am put to sea With her whom here I cannot hold on shore ; And , most <unk> to her need , I have A vessel <unk> fast by , but not prepar ’ d For this design .
What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor <unk> me the <unk> .
CAMILLO .
O my lord , I would your spirit were <unk> for advice , Or stronger for your need .
FLORIZEL .
Hark , Perdita .
&#91; _ Takes her aside . _ &#93; &#91; _ To Camillo . _ &#93; I ’ ll hear you by and by .
CAMILLO .
He ’ s <unk> , <unk> ’ d for flight .
Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn , Save him from danger , do him love and honour , <unk> the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king , my master , whom I so much <unk> to see .
FLORIZEL .
Now , good Camillo , I am so <unk> with curious business that I leave out ceremony .
CAMILLO .
Sir , I think You have heard of my poor services , i ’ th ’ love That I have borne your father ?
FLORIZEL .
Very nobly Have you deserv ’ d : it is my father ’ s music To speak your deeds , not little of his care To have them <unk> ’ d as thought on .
CAMILLO .
Well , my lord , If you may please to think I love the king , And , through him , what ’ s <unk> to him , which is Your gracious self , embrace but my direction , If your more <unk> and settled <unk> May suffer <unk> .
On mine honour , I ’ ll point you where you shall have such <unk> As shall become your highness ; where you may <unk> your mistress ; from the whom , I see , There ’ s no <unk> to be made , but by , As heavens <unk> , your ruin .
Marry her , And with my best <unk> in your absence Your <unk> father strive to <unk> And bring him up to liking .
FLORIZEL .
How , Camillo , May this , almost a miracle , be done ?
That I may call thee something more than man , And after that trust to thee .
CAMILLO .
Have you thought on A place <unk> you ’ ll go ?
FLORIZEL .
Not any yet .
But as th ’ <unk> accident is guilty To what we <unk> do , so we profess <unk> to be the slaves of chance , and flies Of every wind that blows .
CAMILLO .
Then list to me : This follows , if you will not change your purpose , But undergo this flight , make for Sicilia , And there present yourself and your fair princess , For so , I see , she must be , ’ fore Leontes : She shall be <unk> as it becomes The partner of your bed .
Methinks I see Leontes <unk> his free arms and weeping His <unk> forth ; <unk> thee , the son , <unk> , As ’ twere i ’ th ’ father ’ s person ; kisses the hands Of your fresh princess ; o ’ er and o ’ er <unk> him ’ Twixt his unkindness and his kindness .
Th ’ one He <unk> to hell , and bids the other grow <unk> than thought or time .
FLORIZEL .
Worthy Camillo , What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him ?
CAMILLO .
<unk> by the king your father To greet him and to give him comforts .
Sir , The manner of your bearing towards him , with What you ( as from your father ) shall deliver , Things known betwixt us three , I ’ ll write you down , The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say ; that he shall not perceive But that you have your father ’ s bosom there And speak his very heart .
FLORIZEL .
I am bound to you : There is some <unk> in this .
CAMILLO .
A course more <unk> Than a wild <unk> of yourselves To <unk> ’ d waters , <unk> ’ d shores , most certain To miseries enough : no hope to help you , But as you shake off one to take another : Nothing so certain as your <unk> , who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you ’ ll be loath to be .
Besides , you know <unk> ’ s the very bond of love , Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together <unk> <unk> .
PERDITA .
One of these is true : I think affliction may <unk> the cheek , But not take in the mind .
CAMILLO .
Yea , say you so ?
There shall not at your father ’ s house , these seven years Be born another such .
FLORIZEL .
My good Camillo , She is as forward of her breeding as She is i ’ th ’ rear our birth .
CAMILLO .
I cannot say ’ tis pity She lacks <unk> , for she seems a mistress To most that teach .
PERDITA .
Your pardon , sir ; for this I ’ ll blush you thanks .
FLORIZEL .
My <unk> Perdita !
But , O , the thorns we stand upon !
Camillo , <unk> of my father , now of me , The medicine of our house , how shall we do ?
We are not furnish ’ d like Bohemia ’ s son , Nor shall appear in Sicilia .
CAMILLO .
My lord , Fear none of this .
I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there : it shall be so my care To have you <unk> appointed as if The scene you play were mine .
For instance , sir , That you may know you shall not want , — one word .
&#91; _ They talk aside . _ &#93; Enter <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
Ha , ha !
what a fool <unk> is !
and Trust , his sworn brother , a very simple gentleman !
I have sold all my <unk> .
Not a counterfeit stone , not a <unk> , glass , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , knife , <unk> , glove , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to keep my pack from <unk> .
They throng who should buy first , as if my <unk> had been <unk> and brought a <unk> to the <unk> : by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture ; and what I saw , to my good use I <unk> .
My clown ( who wants but something to be a reasonable man ) grew so in love with the wenches ’ song that he would not stir his <unk> till he had both tune and words ; which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears : you might have <unk> a <unk> , it was senseless ; ’ twas nothing to <unk> a <unk> of a purse ; I would have <unk> <unk> off that hung in <unk> : no hearing , no feeling , but my sir ’ s song , and <unk> the nothing of it .
So that in this time of <unk> I <unk> and cut most of their <unk> <unk> ; and had not the old man come in with a <unk> against his daughter and the king ’ s son , and <unk> my <unk> from the <unk> , I had not left a purse alive in the whole army .
Camillo , <unk> and Perdita come forward .
CAMILLO .
Nay , but my letters , by this means being there So soon as you <unk> , shall clear that doubt .
FLORIZEL .
And those that you ’ ll <unk> from king Leontes ?
CAMILLO .
Shall satisfy your father .
PERDITA .
Happy be you !
All that you speak shows fair .
CAMILLO .
&#91; _ Seeing <unk> . _ &#93; Who have we here ?
We ’ ll make an instrument of this ; <unk> Nothing may give us aid .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; If they have <unk> me now , — why , hanging .
CAMILLO .
How now , good fellow !
why <unk> thou so ?
Fear not , man ; here ’ s no harm <unk> to thee .
AUTOLYCUS .
I am a poor fellow , sir .
CAMILLO .
Why , be so still ; here ’ s nobody will steal that from thee : yet , for the <unk> of thy poverty we must make an exchange ; therefore <unk> thee instantly , — thou must think there ’ s a necessity in ’ t — and change garments with this gentleman : though the <unk> on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , there ’ s some boot .
&#91; _ Giving money . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
I am a poor fellow , sir : &#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I know ye well enough .
CAMILLO .
Nay , prithee dispatch : the gentleman is half <unk> already .
AUTOLYCUS .
Are you in earnest , sir ?
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I smell the trick on ’ t .
FLORIZEL .
Dispatch , I prithee .
AUTOLYCUS .
Indeed , I have had earnest ; but I cannot with conscience take it .
CAMILLO .
<unk> , <unk> .
&#91; _ <unk> and <unk> exchange garments . _ &#93; <unk> mistress , — let my <unk> Come home to you ! — you must retire yourself Into some <unk> .
Take your <unk> ’ s hat And pluck it o ’ er your brows , <unk> your face , <unk> you ; and , as you can , <unk> The truth of your own seeming ; that you may ( For I do fear eyes over ) to <unk> Get <unk> .
PERDITA .
I see the play so lies That I must bear a part .
CAMILLO .
No remedy .
Have you done there ?
FLORIZEL .
Should I now meet my father , He would not call me son .
CAMILLO .
Nay , you shall have no hat .
&#91; _ Giving it to Perdita . _ &#93; Come , lady , come .
Farewell , my friend .
AUTOLYCUS .
Adieu , sir .
FLORIZEL .
O Perdita , what have we twain forgot ?
Pray you a word .
&#91; _ They converse apart . _ &#93; CAMILLO .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; What I do next , shall be to tell the king Of this escape , and whither they are bound ; Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after : in whose company I shall <unk> Sicilia ; for whose sight I have a woman ’ s longing .
FLORIZEL .
Fortune speed us !
Thus we set on , Camillo , to the <unk> .
CAMILLO .
The <unk> speed the better .
&#91; _ Exeunt <unk> , Perdita and Camillo . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
I understand the business , I hear it .
To have an open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is necessary for a <unk> ; a good nose is <unk> also , to smell out work for the other senses .
I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive .
What an exchange had this been without boot !
What a boot is here with this exchange !
Sure the gods do this year <unk> at us , and we may do anything <unk> .
The prince himself is about a piece of <unk> , <unk> away from his father with his <unk> at his heels : if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal , I would not do ’ t : I hold it the more knavery to conceal it ; and therein am I constant to my profession .
Enter Clown and <unk> .
Aside , aside ; here is more matter for a hot brain : every <unk> ’ s end , every <unk> , church , <unk> , hanging , <unk> a careful man work .
CLOWN .
See , see ; what a man you are now !
There is no other way but to tell the king she ’ s a <unk> , and none of your flesh and blood .
SHEPHERD .
Nay , but hear me .
CLOWN .
Nay , but hear me .
SHEPHERD .
Go to , then .
CLOWN .
She being none of your flesh and blood , your flesh and blood has not offended the king ; and so your flesh and blood is not to be <unk> by him .
Show those things you found about her , those secret things , all but what she has with her : this being done , let the law go <unk> , I warrant you .
SHEPHERD .
I will tell the king all , every word , yea , and his son ’ s <unk> too ; who , I may say , is no honest man neither to his father nor to me , to go about to make me the king ’ s <unk> .
CLOWN .
Indeed , <unk> was the <unk> off you could have been to him , and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; Very wisely , <unk> !
SHEPHERD .
Well , let us to the king : there is that in this <unk> will make him scratch his beard .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; I know not what <unk> this <unk> may be to the flight of my master .
CLOWN .
Pray heartily he be at ’ palace .
AUTOLYCUS .
&#91; _ Aside . _ &#93; Though I am not <unk> honest , I am so sometimes by chance .
Let me pocket up my <unk> ’ s <unk> .
&#91; _ Takes off his false beard . _ &#93; How now , <unk> !
whither are you bound ?
SHEPHERD .
To the palace , an it like your worship .
AUTOLYCUS .
Your affairs there , what , with whom , the condition of that <unk> , the place of your <unk> , your names , your <unk> , of what having , breeding , and anything that is <unk> to be known ?
discover !
CLOWN .
We are but plain fellows , sir .
AUTOLYCUS .
A lie ; you are rough and <unk> .
Let me have no lying .
It becomes none but <unk> , and they often give us soldiers the lie ; but we pay them for it with <unk> coin , not <unk> steel ; therefore they do not give us the lie .
CLOWN .
Your worship had like to have given us one , if you had not taken yourself with the manner .
SHEPHERD .
Are you a courtier , an ’ t like you , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Whether it like me or no , I am a courtier .
<unk> thou not the air of the court in these <unk> ?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ?
<unk> not thy nose <unk> from me ?
<unk> I not on thy baseness <unk> ?
Think ’ st thou , for that I <unk> , or <unk> from thee thy business , I am therefore no courtier ?
I am courtier _ <unk> _ , and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there .
<unk> I command thee to open thy <unk> .
SHEPHERD .
My business , sir , is to the king .
AUTOLYCUS .
What <unk> hast thou to him ?
SHEPHERD .
I know not , an ’ t like you .
CLOWN .
<unk> ’ s the <unk> for a <unk> .
Say you have none .
SHEPHERD .
None , sir ; I have no <unk> , cock nor <unk> .
AUTOLYCUS .
How bless ’ d are we that are not simple men !
Yet nature might have made me as these are , Therefore I will not disdain .
CLOWN .
This cannot be but a great courtier .
SHEPHERD .
His garments are rich , but he wears them not <unk> .
CLOWN .
He seems to be the more noble in being <unk> : a great man , I ’ ll warrant ; I know by the <unk> on ’ s teeth .
AUTOLYCUS .
The <unk> there ?
What ’ s i ’ th ’ <unk> ?
Wherefore that box ?
SHEPHERD .
Sir , there lies such secrets in this <unk> and box which none must know but the king ; and which he shall know within this hour , if I may come to th ’ speech of him .
AUTOLYCUS .
<unk> , thou hast lost thy labour .
SHEPHERD .
Why , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
The king is not at the palace ; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself : for , if thou <unk> capable of things serious , thou must know the king is full of grief .
SHEPHERD .
So ’ tis said , sir ; about his son , that should have married a shepherd ’ s daughter .
AUTOLYCUS .
If that shepherd be not in <unk> , let him fly .
The curses he shall have , the <unk> he shall feel , will break the back of man , the heart of monster .
CLOWN .
Think you so , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter ; but those that are <unk> to him , though removed fifty times , shall all come under the hangman : which , though it be great pity , yet it is necessary .
An old <unk> rogue , a <unk> , to offer to have his daughter come into grace !
Some say he shall be <unk> ; but that death is too soft for him , say I.
Draw our throne into a <unk> !
All deaths are too few , the <unk> too easy .
CLOWN .
Has the old man e ’ er a son , sir , do you hear , an ’ t like you , sir ?
AUTOLYCUS .
He has a son , who shall be <unk> alive ; then ’ <unk> over with honey , set on the head of a <unk> ’ s nest ; then stand till he be three <unk> and a dram dead ; then <unk> again with <unk> or some other hot <unk> ; then , <unk> as he is , and in the <unk> day <unk> <unk> , shall he be set against a <unk> wall , the sun looking with a <unk> eye upon him , where he is to behold him with flies blown to death .
But what talk we of these <unk> rascals , whose miseries are to be <unk> at , their offences being so <unk> ?
Tell me ( for you seem to be honest plain men ) what you have to the king .
Being something gently <unk> , I ’ ll bring you where he is aboard , tender your persons to his presence , whisper him in your <unk> ; and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits , here is man shall do it .
CLOWN .
He seems to be of great authority : close with him , give him gold ; and though authority be a stubborn bear , yet he is oft led by the nose with gold : show the <unk> of your purse to the <unk> of his hand , and no more ado .
Remember : “ <unk> ’ d ” and “ <unk> alive ” .
SHEPHERD .
An ’ t please you , sir , to undertake the business for us , here is that gold I have .
I ’ ll make it as much more , and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you .
AUTOLYCUS .
After I have done what I promised ?
SHEPHERD .
Ay , sir .
AUTOLYCUS .
Well , give me the moiety .
Are you a party in this business ?
CLOWN .
In some sort , sir : but though my case be a pitiful one , I hope I shall not be <unk> out of it .
AUTOLYCUS .
O , that ’ s the case of the shepherd ’ s son .
Hang him , he ’ ll be made an example .
CLOWN .
<unk> , good comfort !
We must to the king and show our strange sights .
He must know ’ tis none of your daughter nor my sister ; we are gone else .
Sir , I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed , and remain , as he says , your pawn till it be brought you .
AUTOLYCUS .
I will trust you .
<unk> before toward the <unk> ; go on the <unk> .
I will but look upon the <unk> , and follow you .
CLOWN .
We are blessed in this man , as I may say , even blessed .
SHEPHERD .
Let ’ s before , as he bids us .
He was provided to do us good .
&#91; _ Exeunt <unk> and Clown . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
If I had a mind to be honest , I see Fortune would not suffer me : she drops <unk> in my mouth .
I am <unk> now with a double occasion : gold , and a means to do the prince my master good ; which who knows how that may turn back to my <unk> ?
I will bring these two <unk> , these blind ones , aboard him .
If he think it fit to shore them again and that the <unk> they have to the king concerns him nothing , let him call me rogue for being so far <unk> ; for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to ’ t .
To him will I present them .
There may be matter in it .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; ACT V SCENE I. Sicilia .
A Room in the palace of Leontes .
Enter Leontes , <unk> , <unk> , Paulina and others .
<unk> Sir , you have done enough , and have perform ’ d A <unk> sorrow : no fault could you make Which you have not redeem ’ d ; indeed , paid down More <unk> than done trespass : at the last , Do as the heavens have done , forget your evil ; With them , forgive yourself .
LEONTES .
Whilst I remember Her and her virtues , I cannot forget My <unk> in them ; and so still think of The wrong I did myself : which was so much That <unk> it hath made my kingdom , and <unk> ’ d the sweet ’ st companion that e ’ er man <unk> his hopes out of .
PAULINA .
True , too true , my lord .
If , one by one , you wedded all the world , Or from the all that are took something good , To make a perfect woman , she you kill ’ d Would be <unk> ’ d .
LEONTES .
I think so .
Kill ’ d !
She I kill ’ d !
I did so : but thou <unk> ’ st me <unk> , to say I did : it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought .
Now , good now , Say so but seldom .
<unk> Not at all , good lady .
You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and <unk> ’ d Your kindness better .
PAULINA .
You are one of those Would have him wed again .
<unk> .
If you would not so , You pity not the state , nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name ; consider little What dangers , by his highness ’ fail of issue , May drop upon his kingdom , and devour <unk> <unk> .
What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well ?
What <unk> than , for royalty ’ s repair , For present comfort , and for future good , To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to ’ t ?
PAULINA .
There is none worthy , <unk> her that ’ s gone .
Besides , the gods Will have <unk> ’ d their secret purposes ; For has not the divine Apollo said , Is ’ t not the <unk> of his oracle , That king Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found ?
Which that it shall , Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my <unk> to break his grave And come again to me ; who , on my life , Did perish with the infant .
’ Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary , <unk> against their wills .
&#91; _ To Leontes . _ &#93; <unk> not for issue ; The crown will find an heir .
Great Alexander <unk> his to th ’ worthiest ; so his <unk> Was like to be the best .
LEONTES .
Good Paulina , Who hast the memory of Hermione , I know , in honour , O that ever I Had <unk> ’ d me to thy counsel !
Then , even now , I might have look ’ d upon my queen ’ s full eyes , Have taken treasure from her lips , — PAULINA .
And left them More rich for what they yielded .
LEONTES .
Thou speak ’ st truth .
No more such wives ; therefore , no wife : one worse , And better us ’ d , would make her <unk> spirit <unk> possess her <unk> , and on this stage , ( Where we <unk> now appear ) <unk> , And begin “ Why to me ? ” PAULINA .
Had she such power , She had just cause .
LEONTES .
She had ; and would <unk> me To murder her I married .
PAULINA .
I should so .
Were I the ghost that walk ’ d , I ’ d bid you mark Her eye , and tell me for what dull part in ’ t You chose her : then I ’ d <unk> , that even your ears Should <unk> to hear me ; and the words that follow ’ d Should be “ Remember mine . ” LEONTES .
<unk> , stars , And all eyes else dead <unk> !
Fear thou no wife ; I ’ ll have no wife , Paulina .
PAULINA .
Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave ?
LEONTES .
Never , Paulina ; so be bless ’ d my spirit !
PAULINA .
Then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath .
<unk> You tempt him <unk> .
PAULINA .
Unless another , As like Hermione as is her picture , <unk> his eye .
<unk> Good madam , — PAULINA .
I have done .
Yet , if my lord will marry , — if you will , sir , No remedy but you will , — give me the office To choose you a queen : she shall not be so young As was your former , but she shall be such As , walk ’ d your first queen ’ s ghost , it should take joy To see her in your arms .
LEONTES .
My true Paulina , We shall not marry till thou bid ’ st us .
PAULINA .
That Shall be when your first queen ’ s again in breath ; Never till then .
Enter a Servant .
SERVANT .
One that gives out himself Prince <unk> , Son of Polixenes , with his princess ( she The fairest I have yet beheld ) desires access To your high presence .
LEONTES .
What with him ?
he comes not Like to his father ’ s greatness : his approach , So out of circumstance and sudden , tells us ’ Tis not a visitation <unk> ’ d , but forc ’ d By need and accident .
What train ?
SERVANT .
But few , And those but mean .
LEONTES .
His princess , say you , with him ?
SERVANT .
Ay , the most <unk> piece of earth , I think , That e ’ er the sun <unk> bright on .
PAULINA .
O Hermione , As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone , so must thy grave Give way to what ’ s seen now !
Sir , you yourself Have said and writ so , — but your writing now Is <unk> than that theme , — ‘ She had not been , Nor was not to be <unk> ’ d ’ ; thus your verse <unk> ’ d with her beauty once ; ’ tis <unk> ebb ’ d , To say you have seen a better .
SERVANT .
Pardon , madam : The one I have almost forgot , — your pardon ; — The other , when she has obtain ’ d your eye , Will have your tongue too .
This is a creature , Would she begin a <unk> , might quench the zeal Of all <unk> else ; make <unk> Of who she but bid follow .
PAULINA .
How !
not women ?
SERVANT .
Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man ; men , that she is The <unk> of all women .
LEONTES .
Go , <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> with your honour ’ d friends , Bring them to our <unk> .
&#91; _ Exeunt <unk> and others . _ &#93; Still , ’ tis strange He thus should steal upon us .
PAULINA .
Had our prince , <unk> of children , seen this hour , he had pair ’ d Well with this lord .
There was not full a month Between their <unk> .
LEONTES .
Prithee no more ; cease ; Thou know ’ st He dies to me again when talk ’ d of : sure , When I shall see this gentleman , thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may <unk> me of reason .
They are come .
Enter <unk> , Perdita , <unk> and others .
Your mother was most true to <unk> , prince ; For she did print your royal father off , <unk> you .
Were I but <unk> , Your father ’ s image is so hit in you , His very air , that I should call you brother , As I did him , and speak of something <unk> By us perform ’ d before .
Most dearly welcome !
And your fair princess , — goddess !
O , alas !
I lost a couple that ’ twixt heaven and earth Might thus have stood , <unk> wonder , as You , gracious couple , do !
And then I lost , — All mine own folly , — the society , <unk> too , of your brave father , whom , Though bearing misery , I desire my life Once more to look on him .
FLORIZEL .
By his command Have I here touch ’ d Sicilia , and from him Give you all <unk> that a king , at friend , Can send his brother : and , but infirmity , Which <unk> upon worn times , hath something <unk> ’ d His wish ’ d <unk> , he had himself The lands and waters ’ twixt your throne and his <unk> ’ d , to look upon you ; whom he loves , He bade me say so , — more than all the <unk> And those that bear them living .
LEONTES .
O my brother , — Good gentleman ! — the wrongs I have done thee stir <unk> within me ; and these thy offices , So <unk> kind , are as <unk> Of my <unk> <unk> !
Welcome hither , As is the spring to the earth .
And hath he too <unk> ’ d this <unk> to the fearful <unk> , At least <unk> , of the dreadful Neptune , To greet a man not worth her pains , much less Th ’ adventure of her person ?
FLORIZEL .
Good , my lord , She came from <unk> .
LEONTES .
Where the warlike <unk> , That noble honour ’ d lord , is fear ’ d and lov ’ d ?
FLORIZEL .
Most royal sir , from thence ; from him , whose daughter His tears proclaim ’ d his , parting with her : thence , A prosperous <unk> friendly , we have cross ’ d , To execute the charge my father gave me For <unk> your highness : my best train I have from your <unk> shores dismiss ’ d ; Who for Bohemia bend , to signify Not only my success in <unk> , sir , But my <unk> , and my wife ’ s , in safety Here , where we are .
LEONTES .
The blessed gods <unk> all infection from our air whilst you Do <unk> here !
You have a holy father , A <unk> gentleman ; against whose person , So sacred as it is , I have done sin , For which the heavens , taking angry note , Have left me <unk> .
And your father ’ s bless ’ d , As he from heaven <unk> it , with you , Worthy his goodness .
What might I have been , Might I a son and daughter now have look ’ d on , Such goodly things as you !
Enter a Lord .
LORD .
Most noble sir , That which I shall report will bear no credit , Were not the proof so nigh .
Please you , great sir , Bohemia <unk> you from himself by me ; <unk> you to <unk> his son , who has — His dignity and duty both cast off — <unk> from his father , from his hopes , and with A shepherd ’ s daughter .
LEONTES .
Where ’ s Bohemia ?
speak .
LORD .
Here in your city ; I now came from him .
I speak <unk> , and it becomes My marvel and my message .
To your court Whiles he was hast ’ ning — in the chase , it seems , Of this fair couple — <unk> he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother , having both their country <unk> With this young prince .
FLORIZEL .
Camillo has betray ’ d me ; Whose honour and whose honesty till now , <unk> ’ d all <unk> .
LORD .
Lay ’ t so to his charge .
He ’ s with the king your father .
LEONTES .
Who ?
Camillo ?
LORD .
Camillo , sir ; I spake with him ; who now Has these poor men in question .
Never saw I <unk> so <unk> : they kneel , they kiss the earth ; <unk> themselves as often as they speak .
Bohemia stops his ears , and <unk> them With divers deaths in death .
PERDITA .
O my poor father !
The heaven sets spies upon us , will not have Our contract <unk> .
LEONTES .
You are married ?
FLORIZEL .
We are not , sir , nor are we like to be .
The stars , I see , will kiss the <unk> first .
The odds for high and low ’ s alike .
LEONTES .
My lord , Is this the daughter of a king ?
FLORIZEL .
She is , When once she is my wife .
LEONTES .
That “ once ” , I see by your good father ’ s speed , Will come on very <unk> .
I am sorry , Most sorry , you have broken from his liking , Where you were tied in duty ; and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , That you might well enjoy her .
FLORIZEL .
Dear , look up : Though Fortune , <unk> an enemy , Should chase us with my father , power no jot Hath she to change our loves .
Beseech you , sir , Remember since you <unk> ’ d no more to time Than I do now : with thought of such affections , <unk> forth mine <unk> .
At your request My father will grant precious things as trifles .
LEONTES .
Would he do so , I ’ d beg your precious mistress , Which he <unk> but a trifle .
PAULINA .
Sir , my liege , Your eye hath too much youth in ’ t : not a month ’ <unk> your queen died , she was more worth such <unk> Than what you look on now .
LEONTES .
I thought of her Even in these looks I made .
&#91; _ To <unk> . _ &#93; But your petition Is yet <unk> ’ d .
I will to your father .
Your honour not o ’ <unk> by your desires , I am friend to them and you : upon which errand I now go toward him ; therefore follow me , And mark what way I make .
Come , good my lord .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE II .
The same .
Before the Palace .
Enter <unk> and a Gentleman .
AUTOLYCUS .
Beseech you , sir , were you present at this <unk> ?
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
I was by at the <unk> of the <unk> , heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it : <unk> , after a little <unk> , we were all commanded out of the chamber ; only this , methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child .
AUTOLYCUS .
I would most gladly know the issue of it .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
I make a broken <unk> of the business ; but the changes I <unk> in the king and Camillo were very notes of <unk> .
They <unk> almost , with <unk> on one another , to tear the <unk> of their eyes .
There was speech in their <unk> , language in their very <unk> ; they looked as they had heard of a world <unk> , or one <unk> .
A <unk> passion of wonder <unk> in them ; but the <unk> <unk> , that knew no more but seeing could not say if th ’ <unk> were joy or sorrow ; but in the extremity of the one , it must needs be .
Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more .
Enter a Gentleman .
The news , <unk> ?
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
Nothing but <unk> : the oracle is <unk> : the king ’ s daughter is found : such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that <unk> cannot be able to express it .
Here comes the Lady Paulina ’ s steward : he can deliver you more .
Enter a third Gentleman .
How goes it now , sir ?
This news , which is called true , is so like an old tale that the <unk> of it is in strong suspicion .
Has the king found his heir ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Most true , if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance .
That which you hear you ’ ll swear you see , there is such <unk> in the <unk> .
The mantle of Queen Hermione ’ s , her jewel about the neck of it , the letters of <unk> found with it , which they know to be his character ; the majesty of the creature in <unk> of the mother , the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding , and many other <unk> proclaim her with all <unk> to be the king ’ s daughter .
Did you see the meeting of the two kings ?
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
No .
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen , cannot be spoken of .
There might you have beheld one joy crown another , so and in such manner that it <unk> sorrow wept to take leave of them , for their joy <unk> in tears .
There was <unk> up of eyes , holding up of hands , with countenance of such <unk> that they were to be known by garment , not by favour .
Our king , being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter , as if that joy were now become a loss , cries “ O , thy mother , thy mother ! ” then <unk> Bohemia <unk> ; then <unk> his <unk> ; then again <unk> he his daughter with <unk> her ; now he thanks the old shepherd , which stands by like a <unk> <unk> of many kings ’ <unk> .
I never heard of such another encounter , which <unk> report to follow it , and <unk> description to do it .
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
What , pray you , became of <unk> , that carried hence the child ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
Like an old tale still , which will have matter to <unk> , though credit be asleep and not an ear open .
He was torn to pieces with a bear : this <unk> the shepherd ’ s son , who has not only his innocence , which seems much , to <unk> him , but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
What became of his bark and his followers ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
<unk> the same instant of their master ’ s death , and in the view of the shepherd : so that all the instruments which <unk> to <unk> the child were even then lost when it was found .
But O , the noble combat that ’ twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina !
She had one eye <unk> for the loss of her husband , another <unk> that the oracle was <unk> .
She <unk> the princess from the earth , and so locks her in <unk> , as if she would pin her to her heart , that she might no more be in danger of losing .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes ; for by such was it <unk> .
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
One of the <unk> touches of all , and that which <unk> for mine eyes ( caught the water , though not the fish ) was , when at the <unk> of the queen ’ s death ( with the manner how she came to it bravely <unk> and <unk> by the king ) how <unk> wounded his daughter ; till , from one sign of <unk> to another , she did , with an “ Alas , ” I would fain say , bleed tears , for I am sure my heart wept blood .
Who was most marble there changed colour ; some <unk> , all <unk> : if all the world could have seen it , the woe had been <unk> .
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
Are they returned to the court ?
THIRD GENTLEMAN .
No : the princess hearing of her mother ’ s statue , which is in the keeping of Paulina , — a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare Italian master , <unk> <unk> , who , had he himself <unk> , and could put breath into his work , would beguile Nature of her custom , so <unk> he is her ape : he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer .
<unk> with all <unk> of affection are they gone , and there they intend to sup .
SECOND GENTLEMAN .
I thought she had some great matter there in hand ; for she hath <unk> twice or thrice a day , ever since the death of Hermione , <unk> that removed house .
Shall we thither , and with our company piece the <unk> ?
FIRST GENTLEMAN .
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access ?
Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born .
Our absence makes us <unk> to our knowledge .
Let ’ s along .
&#91; _ Exeunt Gentlemen . _ &#93; AUTOLYCUS .
Now , had I not the dash of my former life in me , would <unk> drop on my head .
I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince ; told him I heard them talk of a <unk> and I know not what .
But he at that time <unk> of the shepherd ’ s daughter ( so he then took her to be ) , who began to be much <unk> , and himself little better , extremity of weather <unk> , this mystery <unk> <unk> ’ d .
But ’ tis all one to me ; for had I been the <unk> of this secret , it would not have relish ’ d among my other <unk> .
Enter <unk> and Clown .
Here come those I have done good to against my will , and already <unk> in the <unk> of their fortune .
SHEPHERD .
Come , boy ; I am past more children , but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born .
CLOWN .
You are well met , sir .
You denied to fight with me this other day , because I was no gentleman born .
See you these clothes ?
Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born : you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born .
Give me the lie , do ; and try whether I am not now a gentleman born .
AUTOLYCUS .
I know you are now , sir , a gentleman born .
CLOWN .
Ay , and have been so any time these four hours .
SHEPHERD .
And so have I , boy !
CLOWN .
So you have : but I was a gentleman born before my father ; for the king ’ s son took me by the hand and called me brother ; and then the two kings called my father brother ; and then the prince , my brother , and the princess , my sister , called my father father ; and so we wept ; and there was the first <unk> tears that ever we shed .
SHEPHERD .
We may live , son , to shed many more .
CLOWN .
Ay ; or else ’ twere hard luck , being in so <unk> estate as we are .
AUTOLYCUS .
I humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship , and to give me your good report to the prince my master .
SHEPHERD .
Prithee , son , do ; for we must be gentle , now we are gentlemen .
CLOWN .
Thou wilt amend thy life ?
AUTOLYCUS .
Ay , an it like your good worship .
CLOWN .
Give me thy hand : I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia .
SHEPHERD .
You may say it , but not swear it .
CLOWN .
Not swear it , now I am a gentleman ?
Let <unk> and <unk> say it , I ’ ll swear it .
SHEPHERD .
How if it be false , son ?
CLOWN .
If it be ne ’ er so false , a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend .
And I ’ ll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk ; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk : but I ’ ll swear it ; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands .
AUTOLYCUS .
I will prove so , sir , to my power .
CLOWN .
Ay , by any means , prove a tall fellow : if I do not wonder how thou dar ’ st venture to be drunk , not being a tall fellow , trust me not .
Hark !
the kings and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the queen ’ s picture .
Come , follow us : we ’ ll be thy good masters .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE III .
The same .
A Room in Paulina ’ s house .
Enter Leontes , Polixenes , <unk> , Perdita , Camillo , Paulina , Lords and Attendants .
LEONTES .
O grave and good Paulina , the great comfort That I have had of thee !
PAULINA .
What , sovereign sir , I did not well , I meant well .
All my services You have paid home : but that you have <unk> ’ d , With your crown ’ d brother and these your <unk> <unk> of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , It is a <unk> of your grace which never My life may last to answer .
LEONTES .
O Paulina , We honour you with trouble .
But we came To see the statue of our queen : your <unk> Have we pass ’ d through , not without much content In many <unk> ; but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon , The statue of her mother .
PAULINA .
As she liv ’ d <unk> , So her dead likeness , I do well believe , <unk> <unk> yet you look ’ d upon Or hand of man hath done ; therefore I keep it <unk> , apart .
But here it is : prepare To see the life as <unk> mock ’ d as ever Still sleep mock ’ d death .
Behold , and say ’ tis well .
Paulina <unk> a curtain , and <unk> Hermione standing as a statue .
I like your silence , it the more shows off Your wonder : but yet speak .
First you , my liege .
Comes it not something near ?
LEONTES .
Her natural <unk> !
<unk> me , dear stone , that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione ; or rather , thou art she In thy not <unk> ; for she was as tender As <unk> and grace .
But yet , Paulina , Hermione was not so much <unk> , nothing So aged as this seems .
POLIXENES .
O , not by much !
PAULINA .
So much the more our <unk> ’ s excellence , Which lets go by some <unk> years and makes her As she liv ’ d now .
LEONTES .
As now she might have done , So much to my good comfort as it is Now <unk> to my soul .
O , thus she stood , Even with such life of majesty , warm life , As now it <unk> stands , when first I woo ’ d her !
I am asham ’ d : does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it ?
O royal piece , There ’ s <unk> in thy majesty , which has My evils <unk> ’ d to remembrance and From thy <unk> daughter took the spirits , <unk> like stone with thee .
PERDITA .
And give me leave , And do not say ’ tis <unk> , that I kneel , and then <unk> her blessing .
Lady , Dear queen , that ended when I but began , Give me that hand of yours to kiss .
PAULINA .
O , patience !
The statue is but newly fix ’ d , the colour ’ s Not dry .
CAMILLO .
My lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , Which <unk> <unk> cannot blow away , So many <unk> dry .
<unk> any joy Did ever so long live ; no sorrow But kill ’ d itself much sooner .
POLIXENES .
Dear my brother , Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself .
PAULINA .
Indeed , my lord , If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you — for the stone is mine — I ’ d not have show ’ d it .
LEONTES .
Do not draw the curtain .
PAULINA .
No longer shall you gaze on ’ t , lest your fancy May think anon it moves .
LEONTES .
Let be , let be .
Would I were dead , but that methinks already — What was he that did make it ?
See , my lord , Would you not <unk> it breath ’ d ?
And that those veins Did <unk> bear blood ?
POLIXENES .
<unk> done : The very life seems warm upon her lip .
LEONTES .
The <unk> of her eye has motion in ’ t , As we are mock ’ d with art .
PAULINA .
I ’ ll draw the curtain : My lord ’ s almost so far <unk> that He ’ ll think anon it lives .
LEONTES .
O sweet Paulina , Make me to think so twenty years together !
No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness .
Let ’ t alone .
PAULINA .
I am sorry , sir , I have thus far <unk> ’ d you : but I could <unk> you further .
LEONTES .
Do , Paulina ; For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any <unk> comfort .
Still methinks There is an air comes from her .
What fine <unk> Could ever yet cut breath ?
Let no man mock me , For I will kiss her !
PAULINA .
Good my lord , forbear : The <unk> upon her lip is wet ; You ’ ll mar it if you kiss it , stain your own With <unk> painting .
Shall I draw the curtain ?
LEONTES .
No , not these twenty years .
PERDITA .
So long could I Stand by , a <unk> on .
PAULINA .
Either forbear , <unk> presently the <unk> , or resolve you For more <unk> .
If you can behold it , I ’ ll make the statue move indeed , descend , And take you by the hand .
But then you ’ ll think ( Which I protest against ) I am <unk> By wicked powers .
LEONTES .
What you can make her do I am content to look on : what to speak , I am content to hear ; for ’ tis as easy To make her speak as move .
PAULINA .
It is <unk> ’ d You do awake your faith .
Then all stand still ; Or those that think it is <unk> business I am about , let them depart .
LEONTES .
Proceed : No foot shall stir .
PAULINA .
Music , awake her : strike !
&#91; _ Music . _ &#93; ’ Tis time ; descend ; be stone no more ; approach ; Strike all that look upon with marvel .
Come ; I ’ ll fill your grave up : stir ; nay , come away .
<unk> to death your <unk> , for from him Dear life <unk> you .
You perceive she stirs .
Hermione comes down from the <unk> .
<unk> not ; her actions shall be holy as You hear my <unk> is lawful .
Do not shun her Until you see her die again ; for then You kill her double .
Nay , present your hand : When she was young you woo ’ d her ; now in age Is she become the suitor ?
LEONTES .
&#91; _ <unk> her . _ &#93; O , she ’ s warm !
If this be <unk> , let it be an art <unk> as <unk> .
POLIXENES .
She <unk> him .
CAMILLO .
She hangs about his neck .
If she <unk> to life , let her speak too .
POLIXENES .
Ay , and make it <unk> where she has liv ’ d , Or how stol ’ n from the dead .
PAULINA .
That she is living , Were it but told you , should be <unk> at Like an old tale ; but it appears she lives , Though yet she speak not .
Mark a little while .
Please you to <unk> , fair madam .
<unk> And pray your mother ’ s blessing .
Turn , good lady , Our Perdita is found .
&#91; _ <unk> Perdita who <unk> to Hermione . _ &#93; HERMIONE .
You gods , look down , And from your sacred <unk> pour your graces Upon my daughter ’ s head !
Tell me , mine own , Where hast thou been <unk> ’ d ?
where liv ’ d ?
how found Thy father ’ s court ?
for thou shalt hear that I , Knowing by Paulina that the oracle <unk> hope thou wast in being , have <unk> ’ d Myself to see the issue .
PAULINA .
There ’ s time enough for that ; Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like <unk> .
Go together , You precious <unk> all ; your <unk> <unk> to everyone .
I , an old <unk> , Will wing me to some wither ’ d <unk> , and there My <unk> , that ’ s never to be found again , <unk> till I am lost .
LEONTES .
O peace , Paulina !
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent , As I by thine a wife : this is a match , And made between ’ s by vows .
Thou hast found mine ; But how , is to be question ’ d ; for I saw her , As I thought , dead ; and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave .
I ’ ll not seek far — For him , I partly know his mind — to find thee An honourable husband .
Come , Camillo , And take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty Is <unk> noted , and here <unk> By us , a pair of kings .
Let ’ s from this place .
What !
look upon my brother : both your <unk> , That e ’ er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion .
This your <unk> , And son unto the king , whom heavens <unk> , Is <unk> to your daughter .
Good Paulina , Lead us from hence ; where we may <unk> Each one demand , and answer to his part <unk> ’ d in this wide <unk> of time , since first We were <unk> ’ d .
<unk> lead away !
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; A <unk> ’ S <unk> From off a hill whose <unk> womb <unk> A <unk> story from a <unk> ’ ring <unk> , My spirits t ’ attend this double voice <unk> , And down I laid to list the <unk> ’ d tale ; Ere long <unk> a <unk> maid full pale , <unk> of papers , breaking rings <unk> , <unk> her world with sorrow ’ s wind and rain .
Upon her head a <unk> <unk> of straw , Which <unk> her visage from the sun , Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw The <unk> of a beauty spent and done ; Time had not <unk> all that youth begun , Nor youth all quit , but spite of heaven ’ s fell rage Some beauty <unk> through <unk> of <unk> ’ d age .
Oft did she <unk> her <unk> to her <unk> , Which on it had <unk> <unk> , <unk> ’ ring the silken figures in the <unk> That <unk> woe had <unk> in tears , And often reading what contents it bears ; As often <unk> <unk> ’ d woe , In <unk> of all <unk> , both high and low .
Sometimes her <unk> ’ d eyes their carriage ride , As they did <unk> ’ ry to the <unk> intend ; Sometime <unk> their poor <unk> are tied To th ’ <unk> earth ; sometimes they do extend Their view right on ; anon their <unk> lend To every place at once , and <unk> fix ’ d , The mind and sight <unk> <unk> ’ d .
Her hair , nor loose nor tied in <unk> <unk> , <unk> ’ d in her a careless hand of pride ; For some <unk> ’ d <unk> her <unk> ’ d hat , <unk> her pale and <unk> cheek beside ; Some in her <unk> <unk> still did bide , And , true to bondage , would not break from thence , Though <unk> <unk> in loose <unk> .
A thousand favours from a <unk> she drew , Of <unk> , crystal , and of <unk> <unk> , Which one by one she in a river threw , Upon whose weeping <unk> she was set , Like <unk> <unk> wet to wet , Or <unk> ’ hands , that lets not bounty fall Where want cries ‘ some , ’ but where excess <unk> ‘ all ’ .
Of <unk> <unk> had she many a one , Which she <unk> ’ d , sigh ’ d , <unk> and gave the flood ; <unk> ’ d many a ring of <unk> gold and bone , <unk> them find their <unk> in <unk> ; <unk> yet <unk> letters sadly <unk> ’ d in blood , With <unk> silk , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ’ d , and seal ’ d to curious <unk> .
These often <unk> ’ d she in her <unk> eyes , And often kiss ’ d , and often gave to tear ; <unk> , ‘ O false blood , thou <unk> of lies , What <unk> witness dost thou bear !
<unk> would have seem ’ d more black and damned here ! ’ This said , in top of rage the lines she <unk> , <unk> discontent so breaking their contents .
A reverend man that <unk> his <unk> nigh , Sometime a <unk> , that the <unk> knew Of court , of city , and had let go by The <unk> hours <unk> as they <unk> , <unk> this <unk> fancy <unk> drew ; And , <unk> ’ d by age , desires to know In brief the <unk> and <unk> of her woe .
So <unk> he down upon his <unk> <unk> , And <unk> <unk> sits he by her side , When he again desires her , being sat , Her <unk> with his hearing to divide : If that from him there may be aught <unk> Which may her <unk> <unk> <unk> , ’ Tis promised in the charity of age .
‘ Father , ’ she says , ‘ though in me you behold The injury of many a <unk> hour , Let it not tell your judgement I am old , Not age , but sorrow , over me hath power .
I might as yet have been a <unk> flower , <unk> to myself , if I had <unk> Love to myself , and to no love beside .
‘ But woe is me !
Too early I attended A youthful suit ; it was to gain my grace ; O one by nature ’ s <unk> so <unk> , That maiden ’ s eyes stuck over all his face , Love lack ’ d a <unk> and made him her place ; And when in his fair parts she did abide , She was new <unk> ’ d and newly <unk> .
‘ His <unk> locks did hang in crooked <unk> , And every light occasion of the wind Upon his lips their silken <unk> <unk> , What ’ s sweet to do , to do will <unk> find , Each eye that saw him did <unk> the mind : For on his visage was in little drawn , What <unk> thinks in <unk> was <unk> .
‘ <unk> show of man was yet upon his chin ; His <unk> down began but to appear , Like <unk> velvet , on that <unk> skin , Whose bare <unk> ’ d the <unk> it <unk> to wear .
Yet show ’ d his visage by that cost more dear , And nice affections <unk> stood in doubt If best were as it was , or best without .
‘ His qualities were beauteous as his form , For <unk> he was , and thereof free ; Yet if men mov ’ d him , was he such a storm As oft ’ twixt May and April is to see , When winds breathe sweet , <unk> though they be .
His <unk> so with his <unk> ’ d youth Did livery <unk> in a pride of truth .
‘ Well could he ride , and often men would say That horse his mettle from his <unk> takes , Proud of <unk> , noble by the sway , What <unk> , what bounds , what course , what stop he makes !
And <unk> hence a question takes , Whether the horse by him became his deed , Or he his manage by th ’ <unk> steed .
‘ But quickly on this side the <unk> went , His <unk> <unk> gave life and grace To <unk> and to ornament , <unk> ’ d in himself , not in his case ; All <unk> , themselves made fairer by their place , Came for <unk> ; yet their purpos ’ d trim <unk> ’ d not his grace , but were all <unk> ’ d by him .
‘ So on the <unk> of his <unk> tongue All kind of <unk> and question deep , All <unk> <unk> , and reason strong , For his advantage still did wake and sleep , To make the <unk> laugh , the <unk> weep : He had the <unk> and <unk> skill , <unk> all passions in his craft of will .
‘ That he did in the general bosom reign Of young , of old , and <unk> both <unk> , To dwell with him in thoughts , or to remain In <unk> duty , following where he <unk> , <unk> ’ s <unk> ’ d , ere he desire , have granted , And <unk> for him what he would say , Ask ’ d their own wills , and made their wills obey .
‘ Many there were that did his picture get To serve their eyes , and in it put their mind , Like fools that in th ’ imagination set The goodly <unk> which abroad they find Of lands and <unk> , theirs in thought <unk> ’ d , And <unk> in moe pleasures to bestow them , Than the true <unk> <unk> which doth owe them .
‘ So many have , that never touch ’ d his hand , <unk> <unk> ’ d them mistress of his heart .
My woeful self that did in freedom stand , And was my own <unk> ( not in part ) What with his art in youth , and youth in art , <unk> my affections in his <unk> power , <unk> ’ d the <unk> and gave him all my flower .
‘ Yet did I not , as some my <unk> did , <unk> of him , nor being desired yielded , <unk> myself in honour so forbid , With <unk> distance I mine honour <unk> .
<unk> for me many <unk> <unk> Of <unk> <unk> , which remain ’ d the foil Of this false jewel , and his amorous spoil .
‘ But ah !
Who ever <unk> ’ d by precedent The <unk> ’ d ill she must herself assay , Or force ’ d <unk> ’ gainst her own content , To put the <unk> ’ d <unk> in her way ?
<unk> may stop a while what will not stay : For when we rage , advice is often seen By <unk> us to make our wills more keen .
‘ Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood , That we must curb it upon others ’ proof , To be <unk> the sweets that seems so good , For fear of harms that <unk> in our <unk> .
O appetite , from judgement stand aloof !
The one a <unk> hath that needs will taste , Though reason weep and cry , “ It is thy last . ” ‘ For further I could say , “ This man ’ s <unk> ” , And knew the <unk> of his foul <unk> ; <unk> where his <unk> in others ’ <unk> grew , Saw how <unk> were gilded in his smiling ; <unk> vows were ever <unk> to <unk> ; <unk> <unk> and words merely but art , And <unk> of his foul <unk> heart .
‘ And long upon these terms I held my city , Till thus he ’ <unk> <unk> me : “ Gentle maid , Have of my <unk> youth some feeling pity , And be not of my holy vows afraid : That ’ s to ye sworn , to none was ever said , For feasts of love I have been call ’ d unto , Till now did ne ’ er invite , nor never woo .
‘ “ All my offences that abroad you see Are <unk> of the blood , none of the mind : Love made them not ; with <unk> they may be , Where neither party is nor true nor kind , They sought their shame that so their shame did find , And so much less of shame in me remains , By how much of me their reproach <unk> .
‘ “ Among the many that mine eyes have seen , Not one whose flame my heart so much as <unk> , Or my affection put to th ’ smallest <unk> , Or any of my <unk> ever <unk> : <unk> have I done to them , but ne ’ er was <unk> ; <unk> hearts in <unk> , but mine own was free , And reign ’ d <unk> in his <unk> .
‘ “ Look here what <unk> wounded <unk> sent me , Of <unk> <unk> and <unk> red as blood , <unk> that they their passions likewise lent me Of grief and <unk> , <unk> <unk> In <unk> white and the <unk> ’ d mood ; <unk> of terror and dear modesty , <unk> ’ d in hearts , but fighting <unk> .
‘ “ And , lo !

‘ “ Lo , all these <unk> of affections hot , Of <unk> ’ d and <unk> desires the tender , Nature hath charg ’ d me that I <unk> them not , But yield them up where I myself must render , That is , to you , my <unk> and <unk> : For these of force must your <unk> be , Since I their <unk> , you <unk> me .
‘ “ O then advance of yours that <unk> hand , Whose white <unk> down the <unk> <unk> of praise ; Take all these <unk> to your own command , <unk> with sighs that burning lungs did raise : What me , your minister for you , <unk> , <unk> under you ; and to your <unk> comes Their <unk> <unk> in <unk> sums .
‘ “ Lo , this device was sent me from a <unk> , Or sister <unk> of <unk> note , Which late her noble suit in court did shun , Whose <unk> <unk> made the <unk> dote ; For she was sought by spirits of <unk> coat , But kept cold distance , and did thence remove To spend her living in eternal love .
‘ “ But O , my sweet , what labour is ’ t to leave The thing we have not , <unk> ’ ring what not <unk> , <unk> the place which did no form receive , <unk> patient <unk> in <unk> <unk> , She that her fame so to herself <unk> , The <unk> of battle ’ <unk> by the flight , And makes her absence valiant , not her might .
‘ “ O pardon me , in that my boast is true , The accident which brought me to her eye , Upon the moment did her force <unk> , And now she would the <unk> <unk> fly : <unk> love put out religion ’ s eye : Not to be <unk> would she be <unk> ’ d , And now to tempt all , liberty <unk> ’ d .

‘ “ My parts had pow ’ r to charm a sacred <unk> , Who , <unk> ’ d and <unk> in grace , <unk> ’ d her eyes when they t ’ <unk> begun , All vows and <unk> giving place .
O most <unk> love !

‘ “ Now all these hearts that do on mine depend , <unk> it break , with bleeding groans they pine , And <unk> their sighs to your extend , To leave the <unk> ’ ry that you make ’ gainst mine , <unk> soft audience to my sweet design , And <unk> soul to that <unk> oath , That shall prefer and undertake my troth . ” ‘ This said , his <unk> ’ ry eyes he did <unk> , Whose sights till then were <unk> ’ d on my face ; Each cheek a river running from a <unk> With <unk> current <unk> <unk> apace .
O how the <unk> to the stream gave grace !
Who , <unk> ’ d with crystal gate the <unk> roses That flame through water which their hue <unk> .
‘ O father , what a hell of witchcraft lies In the small <unk> of one particular tear !
But with the <unk> of the eyes What <unk> heart to water will not wear ?

O <unk> effect !

‘ For lo , his passion , but an art of craft , Even there resolv ’ d my reason into tears ; There my white stole of chastity I <unk> ’ d , <unk> off my sober <unk> , and civil fears , Appear to him as he to me appears , All <unk> , though our drops this <unk> ’ <unk> bore : His poison ’ d me , and mine did him restore .
‘ In him a <unk> of subtle matter , <unk> to <unk> , all strange forms <unk> , Of burning <unk> , or of weeping water , Or <unk> <unk> ; and he takes and leaves , In either ’ s <unk> , as it best <unk> , To blush at speeches rank , to weep at woes , Or to turn white and <unk> at <unk> shows .
‘ That not a heart which in his level came Could ’ scape the hail of his <unk> aim , <unk> fair nature is both kind and tame ; And <unk> ’ d in them , did win whom he would <unk> .

‘ Thus merely with the garment of a grace , The naked and <unk> fiend he cover ’ d , That th ’ <unk> gave the <unk> place , Which , like a <unk> , above them <unk> ’ d .
Who , young and simple , would not be so lover ’ d ?
Ay me !

‘ O , that infected <unk> of his eye , O , that false fire which in his cheek so <unk> ’ d !

Did not the heavenly <unk> of thine eye , &apos; Gainst whom the world could not hold argument , <unk> my heart to this false perjury ?
<unk> for thee broke deserve not punishment .
A woman I <unk> ; but I will prove , Thou being a goddess , I <unk> not thee : My vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love ; Thy grace being gain &apos;d <unk> all disgrace in me .
My vow was breath , and breath a <unk> is ; Then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine , <unk> this <unk> vow ; in thee it is : If broken , then it is no fault of mine .
If by me broke , what fool is not so wise To break an oath , to win a <unk> ?
II .
Sweet <unk> , sitting by a brook With young Adonis , lovely , fresh , and green , Did court the lad with many a lovely look , Such looks as none could look but beauty &apos;s queen .
She told him <unk> to delight his ear ; She show &apos;d him favours to <unk> his eye ; To win his heart , she touch &apos;d him here and there : <unk> so soft still conquer chastity .
But whether <unk> years did want conceit , Or he <unk> &apos;d to take her <unk> &apos;d <unk> , The tender <unk> would not touch the bait , But smile and jest at every gentle offer : Then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward ; He rose and ran away ; ah , fool too <unk> !
III .
If love make me forsworn , how shall I swear to love ?
O never faith could hold , if not to beauty vow &apos;d : Though to myself forsworn , to thee I &apos;ll constant prove ; Those thoughts , to me like <unk> , to thee like <unk> bow &apos;d .
<unk> his <unk> leaves , and makes his book thine eyes , Where all those pleasures live that art can <unk> .
If knowledge be the mark , to know thee shall suffice ; Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend ; All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ; Which is to me some praise , that I thy parts <unk> : Thy eye Jove &apos;s lightning seems , thy voice his dreadful thunder , Which ( not to anger bent ) is music and sweet fire .
<unk> as thou art , O do not love that wrong , To sing heavens &apos; praise with such an earthly tongue .
IV .
<unk> had the sun dried up the <unk> morn , And scarce the herd gone to the <unk> for shade , When <unk> , all in love forlorn , A longing <unk> for Adonis made , Under an <unk> growing by a brook , A brook where <unk> used to cool his spleen .
<unk> was the day ; she <unk> that did look For his approach , that often there had been .
Anon he comes , and throws his mantle by , And stood <unk> naked on the brook &apos;s green <unk> ; The sun look &apos;d on the world with glorious eye , Yet not so <unk> as this queen on him : He , <unk> her , <unk> &apos;d in , <unk> he stood ; O Jove , quoth she , why was not I a flood ?
V. Fair is my love , but not so fair as <unk> ; <unk> as a dove , but neither true nor trusty ; <unk> than glass , and yet , as glass is , <unk> ; <unk> than wax , and yet , as iron , <unk> : A lily pale , with <unk> die to grace her , None fairer , nor none <unk> to <unk> her .
Her lips to mine how often hath she join &apos;d , Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing !
How many tales to please me hath she coin &apos;d , <unk> my love , the loss thereof still fearing !
Yet in the <unk> of all her pure <unk> , Her faith , her oaths , her tears , and all were <unk> .
She burn &apos;d with love , as straw with fire <unk> ; She burn &apos;d out love , as soon as straw <unk> ; She <unk> &apos;d the love , and yet she foil &apos;d the <unk> ; She bade love last , and yet she fell a turning .
Was this a lover , or a <unk> whether ?
<unk> in the best , though excellent in neither .
VI .
If music and sweet <unk> agree , As they must needs , the sister and the brother , Then must the love be great &apos; twixt thee and me , Because thou <unk> the one , and I the other .
<unk> to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense ; <unk> to me , whose deep conceit is such As , passing all conceit , needs no defence .
Thou lov &apos;st to hear the sweet <unk> sound That <unk> &apos; lute , the queen of music , makes ; And I in deep delight am <unk> drown &apos;d <unk> himself to singing he <unk> .
One god is god of both , as <unk> <unk> ; One knight loves both , and both in thee remain .
VII .
Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love , * * * * * * <unk> for sorrow than her <unk> dove , For <unk> &apos;s sake , a <unk> proud and wild ; Her stand she takes upon a <unk> hill : Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds ; She , silly queen , with more than love &apos;s good will , <unk> the boy he should not pass those <unk> ; Once , quoth she , did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these <unk> <unk> with a boar , <unk> in the <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> !
See , in my <unk> , quoth she , here was the sore .
She showed hers : he saw more wounds than one , And blushing fled , and left her all alone .
VIII .
Sweet rose , fair flower , untimely pluck &apos;d , soon <unk> , Pluck &apos;d in the bud , and <unk> in the spring !
<unk> <unk> pearl , alack !
too <unk> <unk> !
Fair creature , kill &apos;d too soon by death &apos;s sharp sting !
Like a green <unk> that hangs upon a tree , And falls , through wind , before the fall should be .
I weep for thee , and yet no cause I have ; For why ?
thou left &apos;st me nothing in thy will : And yet thou left &apos;st me more than I did crave ; For why ?
I <unk> nothing of thee still : O yes , dear friend , I pardon crave of thee , Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me .
<unk> .
Venus , with young Adonis sitting by her , Under a <unk> shade , began to woo him : She told the <unk> how god Mars did try her , And as he fell to her , so fell she to him .
Even thus , quoth she , the warlike god <unk> &apos;d me , And then she <unk> &apos;d Adonis in her arms ; Even thus , quoth she , the warlike god <unk> me ; As if the boy should use like loving charms ; Even thus , quoth she , he <unk> on my lips , And with her lips on his did act the <unk> ; And as she <unk> breath , away he <unk> , And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure .
Ah !
that I had my lady at this bay , To kiss and <unk> me till I run away !
<unk> <unk> age and youth Cannot live together Youth is full of <unk> , <unk> is full of care ; Youth like summer morn , <unk> like winter weather ; Youth like summer brave , <unk> like winter bare ; Youth is full of sport , <unk> &apos;s breath is short ; Youth is nimble , age is lame ; Youth is hot and bold , <unk> is weak and cold ; Youth is wild , and age is tame .
<unk> , I do abhor thee ; Youth , I do adore thee ; O , my love , my love is young !
<unk> , I do defy thee ; O , sweet shepherd , hie thee , For methinks thou stay &apos;st too long .
<unk> .
Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good , A shining gloss that <unk> suddenly ; A flower that dies when first it &apos; <unk> to bud ; A <unk> glass , that &apos;s broken presently : A doubtful good , a gloss , a glass , a flower , <unk> , <unk> , broken , dead within an hour .
And as goods lost are <unk> or never found , As <unk> gloss no <unk> will <unk> , As flowers dead lie wither &apos;d on the ground , As broken glass no <unk> can redress , So beauty <unk> &apos;d once , for ever &apos;s lost , In spite of physic , painting , pain and cost .
<unk> .
Good night , good rest .
Ah !
neither be my share : She bade good night that kept my rest away ; And <unk> &apos;d me to a <unk> hang &apos;d with care , To <unk> on the <unk> of my decay .
Farewell , quoth she , and come again tomorrow : Fare well I could not , for I <unk> &apos;d with sorrow ; Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile , In scorn or friendship , <unk> I <unk> whether : &apos; T may be , she joy &apos;d to jest at my exile , &apos; T may be , again to make me wander thither : &apos; <unk> , &apos; a word for shadows like myself , As take the pain , but cannot pluck the <unk> .
<unk> .
Lord , how mine eyes throw <unk> to the east !
My heart doth charge the watch ; the morning rise Doth <unk> each moving sense from idle rest .
Not <unk> trust the office of mine eyes , While <unk> sits and sings , I sit and mark , And wish her lays were <unk> like the lark ; For she doth welcome <unk> with her <unk> , And drives away dark <unk> night : The night so pack &apos;d , I post unto my pretty ; <unk> hath his hope , and eyes their wished sight ; <unk> chang &apos;d to <unk> , <unk> <unk> &apos;d with sorrow ; For why , she sigh &apos;d and bade me come tomorrow .
Were I with her , the night would post too soon ; But now are minutes added to the hours ; To spite me now , each minute seems a moon ; Yet not for me , shine sun to <unk> flowers !
<unk> night , peep day ; good day , of night now borrow : <unk> , night , <unk> , and length thyself to-morrow .
THE <unk> AND THE <unk> Let the bird of <unk> lay , On the sole <unk> tree , Herald sad and trumpet be , To whose sound chaste wings obey .
But thou <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the fiend , <unk> of the fever ’ s end , To this troop come thou not near .
From this <unk> <unk> Every <unk> of tyrant wing , Save the eagle , feather ’ d king ; Keep the <unk> so strict .
Let the priest in <unk> white , That <unk> music can , Be the <unk> <unk> , Lest the <unk> lack his right .
And thou <unk> crow , That thy <unk> <unk> mak ’ st With the breath thou <unk> ’ st and <unk> ’ st , ’ <unk> our <unk> shalt thou go .
Here the <unk> doth <unk> : Love and constancy is dead ; <unk> and the <unk> fled In a mutual flame from hence .
So they lov ’ d , as love in twain Had the <unk> but in one ; Two <unk> , division none : <unk> there in love was slain .
<unk> <unk> , yet not asunder ; <unk> and no space was seen ’ Twixt this <unk> and his queen ; But in them it were a wonder .
So between them love did shine , That the <unk> saw his right <unk> in the <unk> ’ sight ; Either was the other ’ s mine .
<unk> was thus <unk> , That the self was not the same ; <unk> nature ’ s double name Neither two nor one was called .
<unk> , in itself <unk> , Saw division grow together ; To themselves yet either neither , <unk> were so well <unk> .
That it cried , How true a twain <unk> this <unk> one !
Love hath reason , reason none , If what parts can so remain .
<unk> it made this <unk> To the <unk> and the dove , <unk> and stars of love , As <unk> to their <unk> scene .
<unk> Beauty , truth , and <unk> .
Grace in all <unk> , Here <unk> ’ d in <unk> lie .
Death is now the <unk> ’ nest ; And the <unk> ’ s loyal breast To <unk> doth rest .
<unk> no <unk> : — ’ Twas not their infirmity , It was married chastity .
<unk> may seem , but cannot be ; Beauty brag , but ’ tis not she ; <unk> and beauty buried be .
To this <unk> let those repair That are either true or fair ; For these dead birds sigh a prayer .
THE <unk> OF <unk> <unk> THE <unk> <unk> HENRY <unk> , EARL OF <unk> , AND <unk> OF <unk> .
THE love I <unk> to your <unk> is without end ; whereof this <unk> , without beginning , is but a superfluous moiety .
The warrant I have of your honourable disposition , not the worth of my <unk> lines , makes it assured of <unk> .
What I have done is yours ; what I have to do is yours ; being part in all I have , <unk> yours .
Were my worth greater , my duty would show greater ; <unk> , as it is , it is bound to your <unk> , to whom I wish long life , still <unk> with all happiness .
Your <unk> &apos;s in all duty , WILLIAM <unk> .
THE <unk> .
LUCIUS <unk> ( for his <unk> pride <unk> <unk> ) , after he had <unk> his own <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> murdered , and , contrary to the Roman laws and <unk> , not <unk> or <unk> for the people &apos;s <unk> , had possessed himself of the kingdom , went , <unk> with his sons and other <unk> of Rome , to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> which siege the <unk> men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of <unk> <unk> , the king &apos;s son , in their <unk> after supper , every one <unk> the virtues of his own wife ; among whom <unk> <unk> the <unk> chastity of his wife <unk> .
In that pleasant humour they all <unk> to Rome ; and <unk> , by their secret and sudden <unk> , to make trial of that which every one had before <unk> , only <unk> finds his wife , though it were late in the night , <unk> amongst her maids : the other ladies were all found dancing and <unk> , or in several <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> yielded <unk> the victory , and his wife the fame .
At that time <unk> <unk> being <unk> with Lucrece &apos;s beauty , yet <unk> his passions for the present , <unk> with the rest back to the camp ; from whence he shortly after <unk> <unk> himself , and was ( according to his estate ) <unk> <unk> and <unk> by Lucrece at <unk> .
The same night he <unk> <unk> into her chamber , <unk> <unk> her , and early in the morning <unk> away .
Lucrece , in this lamentable plight , <unk> <unk> messengers , one to Rome for her father , another to the camp for Collatine .
They came , the one <unk> with <unk> Brutus , the other with Publius <unk> ; and <unk> Lucrece <unk> in mourning habit , <unk> the cause of her sorrow .
She , first taking an oath of them for her revenge , <unk> the <unk> , and whole manner of his <unk> , and withal suddenly <unk> herself .
Which done , with one consent they all <unk> to root out the whole hated <unk> of the <unk> ; and bearing the dead body to Rome , Brutus acquainted the people with the <unk> and manner of the vile deed , with a bitter <unk> against the tyranny of the king ; <unk> the people were so moved , that with one consent and a general <unk> the <unk> were all <unk> , and the state government changed from kings to <unk> .
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ From the <unk> <unk> all in post , <unk> by the <unk> wings of false desire , <unk> Tarquin leaves the Roman host , And to <unk> bears the <unk> fire Which , in pale <unk> hid , <unk> to <unk> And <unk> with <unk> <unk> the <unk> Of Collatine &apos;s fair love , Lucrece the chaste .
Haply that name of chaste <unk> <unk> set This <unk> edge on his keen appetite ; When Collatine <unk> did not let To praise the clear <unk> red and white Which triumph &apos;d in that sky of his delight , Where mortal stars , as bright as heaven &apos;s beauties , With pure <unk> did him <unk> duties .
For he the night before , in Tarquin &apos;s tent , <unk> &apos;d the treasure of his happy state ; What <unk> wealth the heavens had him lent In the possession of his beauteous <unk> ; <unk> his fortune at such <unk> rate , That kings might be <unk> to more fame , But king nor <unk> to such a <unk> dame .
O happiness enjoy &apos;d but of a few !
And , if possess &apos;d , as soon decay &apos;d and done As is the morning &apos;s <unk> dew Against the golden <unk> of the sun !
An <unk> &apos;d date , <unk> &apos;d ere well begun : Honour and beauty , in the owner &apos;s arms , Are <unk> <unk> &apos;d from a world of harms .
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade The eyes of men without an <unk> ; What <unk> then <unk> be made , To set forth that which is so <unk> ?
Or why is Collatine the <unk> Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown From <unk> ears , because it is his own ?
Perchance his boast of Lucrece &apos; sovereignty <unk> this proud issue of a king ; For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be : Perchance that envy of so rich a thing , <unk> compare , <unk> did sting His <unk> &apos;d thoughts , that <unk> men should <unk> That golden hap which their <unk> want .
But some untimely thought did <unk> His <unk> speed , if none of those ; His honour , his affairs , his friends , his state , <unk> all , with swift intent he goes To quench the <unk> which in his liver <unk> .
O rash false heat , <unk> &apos;d in <unk> cold , Thy hasty spring still <unk> , and ne &apos;er grows old !
When at <unk> this false lord arriv &apos;d , Well was he <unk> &apos;d by the Roman dame , Within whose face beauty and virtue <unk> &apos;d Which of them both should <unk> her fame : When virtue <unk> &apos;d , beauty would blush for shame ; When beauty <unk> <unk> , in despite Virtue would stain that or with silver white .
But beauty , in that white <unk> , From Venus &apos; <unk> doth challenge that fair field : Then virtue <unk> from beauty beauty &apos;s red , Which virtue gave the golden age , to <unk> Their silver cheeks , and call &apos;d it then their shield ; <unk> them thus to use it in the fight , — When shame <unk> &apos;d , the red should <unk> the white .
This <unk> in Lucrece &apos; face was seen , <unk> by beauty &apos;s red , and virtue &apos;s white : Of either &apos;s colour was the other queen , <unk> from world &apos;s <unk> their right : Yet their ambition makes them still to fight ; The sovereignty of either being so great , That oft they <unk> each other &apos;s seat .
Their silent war of <unk> and of roses , Which Tarquin view &apos;d in her fair face &apos;s field , In their pure ranks his traitor eye <unk> ; Where , lest between them both it should be kill &apos;d , The coward captive <unk> &apos;d doth yield To those two <unk> that would let him go , Rather than triumph in so false a foe .
Now thinks he that her husband &apos;s shallow tongue , ( The <unk> prodigal that prais &apos;d her so ) In that high task hath done her beauty wrong , Which far <unk> his barren skill to show : Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe <unk> Tarquin answers with <unk> , In silent wonder of <unk> eyes .
This earthly saint , <unk> by this devil , <unk> <unk> the false <unk> ; For <unk> &apos;d thoughts do seldom dream on evil ; <unk> never <unk> &apos;d no secret <unk> fear : So guiltless she <unk> gives good cheer And reverend welcome to her princely guest , Whose inward ill no outward harm express &apos;d : For that he colour &apos;d with his high estate , <unk> base sin in <unk> of majesty ; That nothing in him seem &apos;d <unk> , Save sometime too much wonder of his eye , Which , having all , all could not satisfy ; But , <unk> rich , so <unk> in his store , That , <unk> &apos;d with much , he <unk> still for more .
But she , that never <unk> &apos;d with stranger eyes , Could pick no meaning from their <unk> looks , Nor read the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of such books ; She touch &apos;d no unknown <unk> , nor fear &apos;d no <unk> ; Nor could she <unk> his wanton sight , More than his eyes were open &apos;d to the light .
He <unk> to her ears her husband &apos;s fame , <unk> in the fields of fruitful Italy ; And <unk> with praises Collatine &apos;s high name , Made glorious by his manly <unk> With <unk> arms and <unk> of victory : Her joy with <unk> <unk> hand she doth express , And , <unk> , so <unk> heaven for his success .
<unk> from the purpose of his coming hither , He makes <unk> for his being there .
No <unk> show of <unk> <unk> weather Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear ; Till <unk> <unk> , mother of <unk> and Fear , Upon the world dim darkness doth <unk> , And in her <unk> prison <unk> the day .
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed , <unk> <unk> with heavy <unk> ; For , after supper , long he <unk> With modest Lucrece , and wore out the night : Now leaden slumber with life &apos;s strength doth fight ; And every one to rest themselves <unk> , Save thieves , and cares , and troubled minds , that wake .
As one of which doth Tarquin lie <unk> The <unk> dangers of his will &apos;s <unk> ; Yet ever to obtain his will <unk> , Though <unk> hopes persuade him to <unk> : <unk> to gain doth <unk> oft for <unk> ; And when great treasure is the meed <unk> &apos;d , Though death be <unk> , there &apos;s no death <unk> &apos;d .
Those that much <unk> are with gain so fond , For what they have not , that which they possess They <unk> and <unk> it from their bond , And so , by <unk> more , they have but less ; Or , <unk> more , the profit of excess Is but to surfeit , and such griefs sustain , That they prove <unk> in this <unk> gain .
The aim of all is but to nurse the life With honour , wealth , and ease , in <unk> age ; And in this aim there is such <unk> strife , That one for all , or all for one we gage ; As life for honour in fell battles &apos; rage ; Honour for wealth ; and oft that wealth doth cost The death of all , and all together lost .
So that in vent &apos;ring ill we leave to be The things we are , for that which we expect ; And this ambitious foul infirmity , In having much , <unk> us with defect Of that we have : so then we do neglect The thing we have ; and , all for want of wit , Make something nothing , by <unk> it .
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make , <unk> his honour to obtain his lust ; And for himself himself he must forsake : Then where is truth , if there be no <unk> ?
When shall he think to find a stranger just , When he himself himself <unk> , <unk> To <unk> tongues and wretched hateful days ?
Now stole upon the time the dead of night , When heavy sleep had <unk> up mortal eyes : No <unk> star did lend his light , No noise but <unk> &apos; and wolves &apos; <unk> cries ; Now serves the season that they may <unk> The silly <unk> ; pure thoughts are dead and still , While lust and murder wake to stain and kill .
And now this <unk> lord leap &apos;d from his bed , <unk> his mantle <unk> o &apos;er his arm ; Is madly <unk> &apos;d between desire and dread ; Th &apos; one sweetly <unk> , th &apos; other <unk> harm ; But honest Fear , <unk> &apos;d with lust &apos;s foul charm , Doth too too oft <unk> him to retire , <unk> away by <unk> rude <unk> .
His <unk> on a flint he softly <unk> , That from the cold stone <unk> of fire do fly ; <unk> a <unk> torch forthwith he <unk> , Which must be <unk> to his <unk> eye ; And to the flame thus speaks <unk> : &apos; As from this cold flint I enforced this fire , So Lucrece must I force to my desire . &apos;
Here pale with fear he doth <unk> The dangers of his loathsome enterprise , And in his inward mind he doth debate What following sorrow may on this arise ; Then looking <unk> , he doth despise His naked armour of <unk> &apos;d lust , And justly thus <unk> his thoughts unjust : &apos; Fair torch , burn out thy light , and lend it not To <unk> her whose light <unk> thine : And die , <unk> &apos;d thoughts , before you blot With your <unk> that which is divine !
<unk> pure <unk> to so pure a <unk> : Let fair <unk> abhor the deed That <unk> and <unk> love &apos;s modest <unk> weed .
<unk> shame to <unk> and to shining arms !
O foul dishonour to my household &apos;s grave !
O <unk> act , <unk> all foul harms !
A <unk> man to be soft fancy &apos;s slave !
True valour still a true respect should have ; Then my <unk> is so vile , so base , That it will live <unk> in my face .
<unk> , though I die , the scandal will <unk> , And be an <unk> in my golden coat ; Some loathsome dash the herald will <unk> , To <unk> me how <unk> I did dote ; That my <unk> , sham &apos;d with the note , Shall curse my bones , and hold it for no sin To wish that I their father had not been .
<unk> win I , if I gain the thing I seek ?
A dream , a breath , a <unk> of <unk> joy : Who <unk> a minute &apos;s mirth to wail a week ?
Or <unk> <unk> to get a toy ?
For one sweet <unk> who will the <unk> destroy ?
Or what fond beggar , but to touch the crown , Would with the sceptre straight be <unk> down ?
<unk> <unk> dream of my intent , Will he not wake , and in a desperate rage <unk> hither , this vile purpose to prevent ?
This siege that hath <unk> his marriage , This <unk> to youth , this sorrow to the <unk> , This dying virtue , this <unk> shame , Whose crime will bear an <unk> blame ?
<unk> , what excuse can my invention make When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed ?
Will not my tongue be mute , my frail joints shake ?
Mine eyes <unk> their light , my false heart bleed ?
The guilt being great , the fear doth still exceed ; And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly , But , <unk> , with trembling terror die .
<unk> <unk> kill &apos;d my son or sire , Or <unk> in <unk> to betray my life , Or were he not my dear friend , this desire Might have excuse to work upon his wife ; As in revenge or <unk> of such strife : But as he is my kinsman , my dear friend , The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end .
<unk> it is ; — ay , if the <unk> be known : <unk> it is : — there is no hate in loving ; I &apos;ll beg her love ; — but she is not her own ; The worst is but <unk> and <unk> : My will is strong , past reason &apos;s weak <unk> .
Who fears a sentence or an old man &apos;s saw Shall by a painted <unk> be kept in awe . &apos;
Thus , <unk> , holds he <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> conscience and <unk> will , And with good thoughts makes <unk> , <unk> the worser sense for vantage still ; Which in a moment doth confound and kill All pure effects , and doth so far proceed , That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed .
<unk> he , &apos; She took me kindly by the hand , And <unk> &apos;d for tidings in my <unk> eyes , <unk> some hard news from the warlike band , Where her beloved <unk> lies .
O how her fear did make her colour rise !
First red as roses that on <unk> we lay , Then white as <unk> , the roses took away .
<unk> how her hand , in my hand being lock &apos;d , <unk> &apos;d it to tremble with her loyal fear ; Which struck her sad , and then it faster rock &apos;d , Until her husband &apos;s <unk> she did hear ; <unk> she <unk> with so sweet a cheer , That had <unk> seen her as she stood , <unk> had never drown &apos;d him in the flood .
<unk> hunt I then for colour or <unk> ?
All <unk> are dumb when beauty <unk> ; Poor <unk> have remorse in poor <unk> ; Love <unk> not in the heart that shadows <unk> : <unk> is my captain , and he <unk> ; And when his <unk> <unk> is <unk> &apos;d , The coward fights and will not be <unk> &apos;d .
<unk> , <unk> fear , <unk> !
<unk> , die !
<unk> and reason wait on <unk> age !
My heart shall never <unk> mine eye ; <unk> pause and deep regard <unk> the <unk> ; My part is youth , and beats these from the stage : <unk> my <unk> is , beauty my prize ; Then who fears <unk> where such treasure lies ? &apos;
As corn o <unk> by weeds , so <unk> fear Is almost <unk> &apos;d by <unk> lust .
Away he steals with <unk> , <unk> ear , Full of foul hope , and full of fond mistrust ; Both which , as <unk> to the unjust , So cross him with their opposite persuasion , That now he vows a league , and now <unk> .
Within his thought her heavenly image sits , And in the <unk> seat sits Collatine : That eye which looks on her <unk> his wits ; That eye which him <unk> , as more divine , Unto a view so false will not <unk> ; But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart , Which once corrupted takes the worser part ; And therein <unk> up his <unk> powers , Who , flatter &apos;d by their <unk> &apos;s <unk> show , <unk> up his lust , as minutes fill up hours ; And as their captain , so their pride doth grow .
<unk> more <unk> tribute than they owe .
By <unk> desire thus madly led , The Roman lord <unk> to Lucrece &apos; bed .
The locks between her chamber and his will , Each one by him <unk> &apos;d <unk> his ward ; But , as they open they all rate his ill , Which drives the <unk> thief to some regard , The <unk> <unk> the door to have him heard ; <unk> &apos;ring <unk> <unk> to see him there ; They fright him , yet he still <unk> his fear .
As each <unk> <unk> <unk> him way , Through little <unk> and <unk> of the place The wind wars with his torch , to make him stay , And blows the smoke of it into his face , <unk> his conduct in this case ; But his hot heart , which fond desire doth <unk> , <unk> forth another wind that fires the torch : And being <unk> , by the light he spies <unk> &apos;s glove , wherein her <unk> <unk> ; He takes it from the rushes where it lies , And <unk> it , the <unk> his finger <unk> : As who should say this glove to wanton tricks Is not <unk> &apos;d : return again in haste ; Thou see &apos;st our mistress &apos; <unk> are chaste .
But all these poor <unk> could not stay him ; He in the worst sense <unk> their <unk> : The doors , the wind , the glove that did delay him , He takes for <unk> things of trial ; Or as those <unk> which stop the hourly <unk> , Who with a <unk> stay his course doth let , Till every minute pays the hour his debt .
<unk> , so , &apos; quoth he , &apos; these lets attend the time , Like little <unk> that sometime threat the spring .
To add a more <unk> to the prime , And give the <unk> birds more cause to sing .
<unk> pays the <unk> of each precious thing ; <unk> rocks , high winds , strong <unk> , <unk> and sands , The merchant fears , ere rich at home he lands . &apos;
Now is he come unto the chamber door , That <unk> him from the heaven of his thought , Which with a yielding <unk> , and with no more , Hath <unk> &apos;d him from the blessed thing he sought .
So from himself <unk> hath wrought , That for his prey to pray he doth begin , As if the heavens should countenance his sin .
But in the <unk> of his <unk> prayer , Having <unk> the eternal power , That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair , And they would stand <unk> to the hour , Even there he starts : — quoth he , &apos; I must <unk> ; The powers to whom I pray abhor this <unk> , How can they then <unk> me in the act ?
<unk> Love and Fortune be my gods , my guide !
My will is back &apos;d with resolution : <unk> are but dreams till their effects be tried , The <unk> sin is clear &apos;d with <unk> ; Against love &apos;s fire fear &apos;s <unk> hath <unk> .
The eye of heaven is out , and <unk> night <unk> the shame that follows sweet delight . &apos;
This said , his guilty hand pluck &apos;d up the <unk> , And with his knee the door he <unk> wide : The dove sleeps fast that this <unk> will catch ; Thus treason works ere traitors be <unk> .
Who sees the <unk> serpent steps aside ; But she , sound sleeping , fearing no such thing , Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting .
Into the chamber <unk> he <unk> , And <unk> on her yet <unk> bed .
The <unk> being close , about he walks , <unk> his <unk> <unk> in his head : By their high treason is his heart <unk> ; Which gives the <unk> to his hand full soon To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon .
Look , as the fair and <unk> sun , <unk> from forth a cloud , <unk> our sight ; Even so , the curtain drawn , his eyes begun To wink , being <unk> with a greater light : Whether it is that she <unk> so bright , That <unk> them , or else some shame supposed ; But blind they are , and keep themselves <unk> .
O , had they in that <unk> prison died , Then had they seen the period of their ill !
Then Collatine again by Lucrece &apos; side In his clear bed might have <unk> still : But they must ope , this blessed league to kill ; And <unk> Lucrece to their sight Must sell her joy , her life , her world &apos;s delight .
Her lily hand her <unk> cheek lies under , <unk> the pillow of a lawful kiss ; Who , therefore angry , seems to part in <unk> , <unk> on either side to want his bliss ; Between whose hills her head <unk> is : Where , like a virtuous monument , she lies , To be <unk> &apos;d of <unk> <unk> &apos;d eyes .
Without the bed her other fair hand was , On the green <unk> ; whose perfect white Show &apos;d like an April <unk> on the grass , With <unk> sweat , <unk> dew of night , Her eyes , like <unk> , had <unk> &apos;d their light , And <unk> in darkness sweetly lay , Till they might open to <unk> the day .
Her hair , like golden <unk> , play &apos;d with her breath ; O modest <unk> !
wanton modesty !
<unk> life &apos;s triumph in the <unk> of death , And death &apos;s dim look in life &apos;s mortality : Each in her sleep themselves so <unk> , As if between them twain there were no strife , But that life liv &apos;d in death , and death in life .
Her <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> with blue , A pair of maiden <unk> <unk> , Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew , And him by oath they truly <unk> .
These <unk> in Tarquin new ambition bred : Who , like a foul <unk> , went about From this fair throne to <unk> the owner out .
What could he see but mightily he noted ?
What did he note but strongly he desir &apos;d ?
What he beheld , on that he <unk> <unk> , And in his will his <unk> eye he <unk> &apos;d .
With more than <unk> he <unk> &apos;d Her <unk> veins , her <unk> skin , Her <unk> lips , her <unk> <unk> chin .
As the grim lion <unk> o &apos;er his prey , <unk> hunger by the conquest satisfied , So o &apos;er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay , His rage of lust by <unk> <unk> ; <unk> &apos;d , not <unk> &apos;d ; for standing by her side , His eye , which late this mutiny <unk> , Unto a greater <unk> <unk> his veins : And they , like <unk> slaves for <unk> fighting , <unk> <unk> .
fell <unk> <unk> , In bloody death and <unk> <unk> , Nor children &apos;s tears nor mothers &apos; groans <unk> , <unk> in their pride , the <unk> still <unk> : Anon his beating heart , alarum <unk> , Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking .
His <unk> heart <unk> up his burning eye , His eye commends the leading to his hand ; His hand , as proud of such a dignity , <unk> with pride , march &apos;d on to make his stand On her bare breast , the heart of all her land ; Whose ranks of blue veins , as his hand did <unk> , <unk> their round <unk> <unk> and pale .
They , <unk> to the quiet <unk> Where their dear <unk> and lady lies , Do tell her she is <unk> <unk> , And fright her with confusion of their cries : She , much amaz &apos;d , breaks ope her lock <unk> eyes , Who , <unk> forth this <unk> to behold , Are by his <unk> torch <unk> &apos;d and <unk> &apos;d .
<unk> her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking , That thinks she hath beheld some <unk> <unk> , Whose grim aspect sets every joint a <unk> : What terror &apos; tis !
but she , in worser taking , From sleep <unk> , <unk> doth view The sight which makes supposed terror true .
<unk> &apos;d and <unk> in a thousand fears , Like to a <unk> &apos;d bird she trembling lies ; She dares not look ; yet , <unk> , there appears <unk> <unk> , ugly in her eyes : Such shadows are the weak brain &apos;s <unk> : Who , angry that the eyes fly from their lights , In darkness <unk> them with more dreadful sights .
His hand , that yet remains upon her breast , ( <unk> <unk> , to <unk> such an <unk> wall ! )
May feel her heart , poor <unk> , distress &apos;d , <unk> itself to death , rise up and fall , <unk> her bulk , that his hand shakes withal .
This moves in him more rage , and lesser pity , To make the breach , and enter this sweet city .
First , like a trumpet , doth his tongue begin To sound a parley to his <unk> foe , Who o &apos;er the white <unk> peers her <unk> chin , The reason of this rash <unk> to know , Which he by dumb <unk> seeks to show ; But she with <unk> prayers <unk> still Under what colour he <unk> this ill .
Thus he <unk> : &apos; The colour in thy face , ( That even for anger makes the lily pale , And the red rose blush at her own disgrace ) Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale : Under that colour am I come to <unk> Thy <unk> &apos;d <unk> : the fault is thine , For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine .
<unk> I <unk> thee , if thou mean to chide : Thy beauty hath <unk> thee to this night , Where thou with patience must my will abide , My will that marks thee for my earth &apos;s delight , Which I to conquer sought with all my might ; But as reproof and reason beat it dead , By thy bright beauty was it newly bred .
<unk> see what <unk> my attempt will bring ; I know what thorns the growing rose <unk> ; I think the honey guarded with a sting ; All this , <unk> , counsel <unk> : But will is deaf , and hears no <unk> friends ; Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty , And <unk> on what he looks , &apos; gainst law or duty .
<unk> have <unk> , even in my soul , What wrong , what shame , what sorrow I shall breed ; But nothing can <unk> &apos;s course control , Or stop the <unk> fury of his speed .
I know <unk> tears <unk> the deed , <unk> , disdain , and deadly enmity ; Yet strike I to embrace mine infamy . &apos;
This said , he shakes aloft his Roman <unk> , Which , like a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> below with his wings &apos; shade , Whose crooked <unk> <unk> if he mount he dies : So under his <unk> <unk> lies <unk> <unk> , <unk> what he tells With trembling fear , as <unk> hear <unk> &apos;s bells .
<unk> , &apos; quoth he , &apos; this night I must enjoy thee : If thou deny , then force must work my way , For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee ; That done , some worthless slave of thine I &apos;ll slay .
To kill thine honour with thy life &apos;s decay ; And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him , <unk> I slew him , seeing thee embrace him .
<unk> thy <unk> husband shall remain The <unk> mark of every open eye ; Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain , Thy issue <unk> &apos;d with <unk> <unk> : And thou , the author of their <unk> , <unk> have thy trespass <unk> up in <unk> , And sung by children in <unk> times .
<unk> if thou yield , I rest thy secret friend : The fault unknown is as a thought <unk> ; A little harm , done to a great good end , For lawful policy remains <unk> .
The <unk> simple sometimes is <unk> In a pure compound ; being so <unk> , His venom in effect is <unk> .
<unk> , for thy husband and thy children &apos;s sake , <unk> my suit : bequeath not to their <unk> The shame that from them no device can take , The <unk> that will never be forgot ; <unk> than a <unk> wipe , or <unk> &apos;s blot : For marks <unk> in men &apos;s <unk> Are nature &apos;s faults , not their own infamy . &apos;
Here with a <unk> &apos; <unk> eye He <unk> up himself and makes a pause ; While she , the picture of pure <unk> , Like a white <unk> under the <unk> &apos;s sharp <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> where are no laws , To the rough beast that knows no gentle right , Nor aught <unk> but his foul appetite .
But when a <unk> &apos;d cloud the world doth threat , In his dim <unk> the <unk> mountains <unk> , From earth &apos;s dark womb some gentle <unk> doth get , Which blows these <unk> <unk> from their <unk> , <unk> their present fall by this <unk> ; So his <unk> &apos;d haste her words <unk> , And <unk> <unk> <unk> while <unk> plays .
Yet , foul <unk> cat , he doth but <unk> , While in his <unk> foot the weak mouse <unk> ; Her sad behaviour feeds his <unk> folly , A <unk> <unk> that even in plenty <unk> : His ear her prayers <unk> , but his heart <unk> No <unk> entrance to her <unk> : <unk> <unk> lust , though marble wear with <unk> .
Her <unk> eyes are sadly fix &apos;d In the <unk> <unk> of his face ; Her modest <unk> with sighs is <unk> &apos;d , Which to her <unk> <unk> more grace .
She puts the period often from his place , And <unk> the sentence so her accent breaks , That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks .
She <unk> him by high <unk> Jove , By <unk> , gentry , and sweet friendship &apos;s oath , By her untimely tears , her husband &apos;s love , By holy human law , and common troth , By heaven and earth , and all the power of both , That to his borrow &apos;d bed he make retire , And stoop to honour , not to foul desire .
<unk> she , &apos; <unk> not <unk> With such black <unk> as thou hast <unk> ; <unk> not the fountain that gave drink to thee ; <unk> not the thing that cannot be <unk> ; <unk> thy ill aim before the shoot be ended : He is no <unk> that doth bend his bow To strike a poor <unk> doe .
<unk> husband is thy friend ; for his sake spare me ; Thyself art mighty ; for thine own sake leave me ; Myself a <unk> , do not then <unk> me ; Thou look &apos;st not like deceit ; do not deceive me ; My sighs , like <unk> , labour hence to <unk> thee .
If ever man were mov &apos;d with woman &apos;s <unk> , Be moved with my tears , my sighs , my groans : &apos; All which together , like a troubled ocean , <unk> at thy <unk> and <unk> heart ; To <unk> it with their <unk> motion ; For stones <unk> &apos;d to water do <unk> .
O , if no <unk> than a stone thou art , <unk> at my tears , and be <unk> !
Soft pity <unk> at an iron gate .
<unk> Tarquin &apos;s likeness I did entertain thee ; Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame ?
To all the host of heaven I complain me , Thou wrong &apos;st his honour , wound &apos;st his princely name .
Thou art not what thou seem &apos;st ; and if the same , Thou seem &apos;st not what thou art , a god , a king ; For kings like gods should govern every thing .
<unk> will thy shame be <unk> in thine age , When thus thy <unk> bud before thy spring !
If in thy hope thou dar &apos;st do such <unk> , What dar &apos;st thou not when once thou art a king !
O , be remember &apos;d , no <unk> thing From vassal <unk> can he <unk> &apos;d away ; Then kings &apos; <unk> cannot be hid in clay .
<unk> deed will make thee only lov &apos;d for fear , But happy <unk> still are fear &apos;d for love : With foul <unk> thou perforce must bear , When they in thee the like offences prove : If but for fear of this , thy will remove ; For princes are the glass , the school , the book , Where subjects eyes do learn , do read , do look .
<unk> wilt thou be the school where <unk> shall learn ?
Must he in thee read <unk> of such shame : Wilt thou be glass , wherein it shall <unk> <unk> for sin , warrant for blame , To privilege dishonour in thy name ?
Thou back &apos;st reproach against <unk> <unk> , And mak &apos;st fair reputation but a bawd .
<unk> thou command ?
by him that gave it thee , From a pure heart command thy rebel will : Draw not thy sword to guard <unk> , For it was lent thee all that <unk> to kill .
Thy princely office how canst thou <unk> , When , pattern &apos;d by thy fault , foul <unk> may say He learn &apos;d to sin , and thou didst teach the way ?
<unk> but how vile a <unk> it were To view thy present trespass in another .
Men &apos;s faults do seldom to themselves appear ; Their own <unk> <unk> they smother : This guilt would seem <unk> in thy brother .
O how are they <unk> &apos;d in with <unk> That from their own <unk> <unk> their eyes !
<unk> thee , to thee , my <unk> <unk> hands appeal , Not to <unk> lust , thy rash <unk> ; I sue for <unk> &apos;d majesty &apos;s <unk> ; Let him return , and flattering thoughts retire : His true respect will &apos; prison false desire , And wipe the dim <unk> from thy doting <unk> , That thou shalt see thy state , and pity mine . &apos;
<unk> done , &apos; quoth he : &apos; my <unk> tide <unk> not , but <unk> the higher by this let .
<unk> lights are soon blown out , huge fires abide , And with the wind in greater fury <unk> : The petty <unk> that pay a daily debt To their salt sovereign , with their fresh falls &apos; haste , <unk> to his flow , but alter not his taste . &apos;
<unk> art , &apos; quoth she , &apos; a sea , a sovereign king ; And , lo , there falls into thy <unk> flood Black lust , dishonour , shame , <unk> , Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood .
If all these petty <unk> shall change thy good , Thy sea within a <unk> &apos;s womb is hears &apos;d , And not the <unk> in thy sea <unk> &apos;d .
<unk> shall these slaves be king , and thou their slave ; Thou nobly base , they <unk> <unk> ; Thou their fair life , and they thy <unk> grave ; Thou <unk> in their shame , they in thy pride : The lesser thing should not the greater hide ; The <unk> <unk> not to the base <unk> &apos;s foot , But low <unk> whither at the <unk> &apos;s root .
<unk> let thy thoughts , low <unk> to thy state &apos; — &apos; No more , &apos; quoth he ; &apos; by heaven , I will not hear thee : Yield to my love ; if not , enforced hate , <unk> of love &apos;s <unk> touch , shall <unk> tear thee ; That done , <unk> I mean to bear thee Unto the base bed of some rascal groom , To be thy partner in this shameful doom . &apos;
This said , he sets his foot upon the light , For light and lust are deadly enemies ; <unk> <unk> up in blind <unk> night , When most unseen , then most doth <unk> .
The wolf hath <unk> &apos;d his prey , the poor lamb cries ; Till with her own white <unk> her voice <unk> &apos;d <unk> her <unk> in her lips &apos; sweet <unk> : For with the nightly linen that she wears He <unk> her piteous <unk> in her head ; <unk> his hot face in the <unk> tears That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed .
O , that <unk> lust should stain so pure a bed !
The <unk> whereof could weeping <unk> , Her tears should drop on them <unk> .
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life , And he hath won what he would lose again .
This forced league doth force a further strife ; This <unk> joy breeds months of pain , This hot desire <unk> to cold disdain : <unk> <unk> is <unk> of her store , And <unk> , the thief , far <unk> than before .
Look , as the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , <unk> for tender smell or speedy flight , Make slow pursuit , or altogether <unk> The prey wherein by nature they delight ; So <unk> Tarquin fares this night : His taste <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> his will , that liv &apos;d by foul <unk> .
O <unk> sin than <unk> conceit Can <unk> in still imagination !
<unk> desire must <unk> his receipt , Ere he can see his own <unk> .
While lust is in his pride no <unk> Can curb his heat , or rein his rash desire , Till , like a jade , <unk> himself doth <unk> .
And then with <unk> and lean <unk> &apos;d cheek , With heavy eye , knit brow , and <unk> pace , <unk> desire , all <unk> , poor , and <unk> , Like to a <unk> beggar <unk> his case : The flesh being proud , desire doth fight with Grace , For there it revels ; and when that <unk> , The guilty rebel for <unk> prays .
So fares it with this <unk> lord of Rome , Who this <unk> so <unk> <unk> &apos;d ; For now against himself he sounds this doom , That through the length of times he stands <unk> &apos;d : Besides , his soul &apos;s fair temple is <unk> &apos;d ; To whose weak <unk> muster troops of cares , To ask the <unk> princess how she fares .
She says , her subjects with foul <unk> Have <unk> &apos;d down her <unk> wall , And by their mortal fault brought in <unk> Her <unk> , and made her <unk> To living death , and pain perpetual ; Which in her <unk> she <unk> still , But her <unk> could not <unk> their will .
Even in this thought through the dark night he <unk> , A captive <unk> that hath lost in gain ; <unk> away the wound that nothing <unk> , The <unk> that will , despite of cure , remain ; <unk> his spoil <unk> &apos;d in greater pain .
She hears the load of lust he left behind , And he the <unk> of a guilty mind .
He like a <unk> dog <unk> sadly thence ; She like a <unk> lamb lies <unk> there ; He <unk> , and hates himself for his offence ; She , desperate , with her nails her flesh doth tear ; He <unk> flies , <unk> with guilty fear ; She stays , <unk> on the <unk> night ; He runs , and <unk> his vanish &apos;d , loath &apos;d delight .
He thence <unk> a heavy <unk> ; She there remains a <unk> <unk> : He in his speed looks for the morning light ; She prays she never may behold the day ; &apos; For day , &apos; quoth she , &apos; night &apos;s <unk> doth open lay ; And my true eyes have never <unk> &apos;d how To cloak offences with a cunning brow .
<unk> think not but that every eye can see The same disgrace which they themselves behold ; And therefore would they still in darkness be , To have their unseen sin remain <unk> ; For they their guilt with weeping will unfold , And grave , like water that doth eat in steel , Upon my cheeks what <unk> shame I feel . &apos;
Here she <unk> against repose and rest , And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind .
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast , And bids it leap from thence , where it may find Some <unk> <unk> , to close so pure a mind .
<unk> with grief thus <unk> she forth her spite Against the unseen <unk> of night : &apos; O <unk> night , image of hell !
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of shame !
Black stage for <unk> and murders fell !
<unk> <unk> <unk> !
nurse of blame !
<unk> <unk> bawd !
dark harbour for <unk> !
<unk> cave of death , <unk> <unk> With <unk> treason and the <unk> !
<unk> hateful , <unk> , and <unk> night !
Since thou art guilty of my <unk> crime , <unk> thy <unk> to meet the <unk> light , Make war against proportion &apos;d course of time !
Or if thou wilt <unk> the sun to climb His <unk> height , yet ere he go to bed , <unk> <unk> clouds about his golden head .
<unk> rotten <unk> ravish the morning air ; Let their <unk> &apos;d <unk> <unk> make sick The life of <unk> , the <unk> fair , Ere he <unk> his weary <unk> prick ; And let thy <unk> <unk> march so thick , That in their <unk> ranks his smother &apos;d light May set at noon and make perpetual night .
<unk> Tarquin night ( as he is but night &apos;s child ) , The <unk> queen he would <unk> ; Her <unk> <unk> too , by him <unk> &apos;d , Through <unk> &apos;s black bosom should not peep again : So should I have <unk> in my pain : And fellowship in woe doth woe <unk> , As <unk> &apos; <unk> makes short their pilgrimage .
<unk> now I have no one to blush with me , To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine , To mask their brows , and hide their infamy ; But I alone alone must sit and pine , <unk> the earth with showers of silver <unk> , <unk> my talk with tears , my grief with groans , Poor <unk> <unk> of lasting <unk> .
<unk> night , thou <unk> of <unk> smoke , Let not the jealous day behold that face Which <unk> thy black <unk> cloak <unk> lies <unk> &apos;d with disgrace !
Keep still possession of thy <unk> place , That all the faults which in thy reign are made , May likewise be <unk> in thy shade !
<unk> me not object to the <unk> day !
The light will show , character &apos;d in my brow , The story of sweet chastity &apos;s decay , The <unk> breach of holy <unk> vow : Yea , the <unk> , that know not how To <unk> what is writ in learned books , Will <unk> my loathsome trespass in my looks .
<unk> nurse , to still her child , will tell my story And fright her crying babe with Tarquin &apos;s name ; The <unk> , to deck his <unk> , Will couple my reproach to Tarquin &apos;s shame : <unk> <unk> , <unk> my <unk> , Will tie the <unk> to attend each line , How Tarquin wronged me , I Collatine .
<unk> my good name , that senseless reputation , For Collatine &apos;s dear love be kept <unk> : If that be made a theme for <unk> , The branches of another root are <unk> , And <unk> reproach to him <unk> , That is as clear from this <unk> of mine As I , ere this , was pure to Collatine .
<unk> unseen shame !
invisible disgrace !
O <unk> sore !
<unk> , private <unk> !
<unk> is stamp &apos;d in <unk> &apos; face , And Tarquin &apos;s eye may read the <unk> afar , How he in peace is wounded , not in war .
Alas , how many bear such shameful blows , Which not themselves , but he that gives them knows !
<unk> , Collatine , thine honour lay in me , From me by strong assault it is bereft .
My honey lost , and I , a <unk> <unk> , Have no perfection of my summer left , But robb &apos;d and <unk> &apos;d by <unk> theft : In thy weak <unk> a <unk> <unk> hath crept , And suck &apos;d the honey which thy chaste <unk> kept .
<unk> am I guilty of thy honour &apos;s wrack ; — Yet for thy honour did I entertain him ; Coming from thee , I could not put him back , For it had been dishonour to disdain him : Besides , of <unk> he did complain him , And talk &apos;d of virtue : — O <unk> <unk> evil , When virtue is <unk> &apos;d in such a devil !
<unk> should the worm <unk> the maiden bud ?
Or hateful <unk> hatch in <unk> &apos; <unk> ?
Or <unk> infect fair <unk> with venom <unk> ?
Or tyrant folly <unk> in gentle <unk> ?
Or kings be <unk> of their own <unk> ?
But no perfection is so absolute , That some <unk> doth not <unk> .
<unk> aged man that <unk> up his gold Is <unk> with <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> fits ; And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold , But like <unk> <unk> he sits , And <unk> <unk> the harvest of his wits ; Having no other pleasure of his gain But torment that it cannot cure his pain .
<unk> then he hath it when he cannot use it , And leaves it to be master &apos;d by his young ; Who in their pride do presently abuse it : Their father was too weak , and they too strong , To hold their <unk> fortune long .
The sweets we wish for turn to <unk> <unk> , Even in the moment that we call them ours .
<unk> <unk> wait on the tender spring ; <unk> weeds take root with precious flowers ; The <unk> <unk> where the sweet birds sing ; What virtue breeds <unk> <unk> : We have no good that we can say is ours , But <unk> <unk> Or kills his life or else his quality .
<unk> <unk> , thy guilt is great : &apos; Tis thou that <unk> the traitor &apos;s treason ; Thou set &apos;st the wolf where he the lamb may get ; <unk> <unk> the sin , thou &apos; point &apos;st the season ; &apos; Tis thou that spurn &apos;st at right , at law , at reason ; And in thy <unk> cell , where none may spy him , <unk> <unk> , to seize the souls that wander by him .
<unk> mak &apos;st the <unk> <unk> her oath ; Thou blow &apos;st the fire when <unk> is <unk> &apos;d ; Thou smother &apos;st honesty , thou <unk> &apos;st troth ; Thou foul <unk> !
thou <unk> bawd !
Thou <unk> scandal and <unk> <unk> : Thou <unk> , thou traitor , thou false thief , Thy honey turns to gall , thy joy to grief !
<unk> secret pleasure turns to open shame , Thy private <unk> to a public fast ; Thy <unk> titles to a ragged name , Thy sugar &apos;d tongue to bitter <unk> taste : Thy violent <unk> can never last .
How comes it then , vile <unk> , Being so bad , such numbers seek for thee ?
<unk> wilt thou be the humble <unk> &apos;s friend , And bring him where his suit may be obtain &apos;d ?
When wilt thou sort an hour great <unk> to end ?
Or free that soul which <unk> hath chain &apos;d ?
Give physic to the sick , ease to the pain &apos;d ?
The poor , lame , blind , <unk> , creep , cry out for thee ; But they ne &apos;er meet with <unk> .
<unk> patient dies while the physician sleeps ; The <unk> <unk> while the <unk> feeds ; Justice is <unk> while the widow weeps ; <unk> is <unk> while infection breeds ; Thou grant &apos;st no time for charitable deeds : <unk> , envy , treason , <unk> , and murder &apos;s <unk> , Thy heinous hours wait on them as their <unk> .
<unk> truth and virtue have to do with thee , A thousand <unk> keep them from thy aid ; They buy thy help ; but <unk> ne &apos;er gives a fee , He <unk> comes ; and thou art well <unk> &apos;d As well to hear as grant what he hath said .
My Collatine would else have come to me When Tarquin did , but he was stay &apos;d by thee .
<unk> thou art of murder and of theft ; <unk> of perjury and <unk> ; <unk> of treason , <unk> , and shift ; <unk> of <unk> , that <unk> : An <unk> by thine <unk> To all sins past , and all that are to come , From the <unk> to the general doom .
<unk> Time , <unk> of ugly night , <unk> subtle post , <unk> of <unk> care , <unk> of youth , false slave to false delight , <unk> watch of woes , sin &apos;s <unk> , virtue &apos;s <unk> ; Thou <unk> all and <unk> all that are : O hear me then , <unk> , <unk> Time !
Be guilty of my death , since of my crime .
<unk> hath thy servant , <unk> , <unk> &apos;d the hours thou gav &apos;st me to repose ?
<unk> &apos;d my fortunes , and <unk> me To <unk> date of <unk> woes ?
Time &apos;s office is to fine the hate of foes ; To eat up <unk> by opinion bred , Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed .
<unk> &apos;s glory is to calm <unk> kings , To <unk> falsehood , and bring truth to light , To stamp the seal of time in aged things , To wake the morn , and <unk> the night , To wrong the <unk> till he render right ; To <unk> proud <unk> with thy hours , And <unk> with dust their <unk> golden <unk> : &apos; To fill with <unk> <unk> <unk> , To feed oblivion with decay of things , To blot old books and alter their contents , To pluck the <unk> from ancient <unk> &apos; wings , To dry the old oak &apos;s <unk> and cherish <unk> ; To spoil <unk> of <unk> &apos;d steel , And turn the giddy round of Fortune &apos;s wheel ; &apos; To show the <unk> daughters of her daughter , To make the child a man , the man a child , To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter , To tame the <unk> and lion wild , To mock the subtle , in themselves <unk> &apos;d ; To cheer the <unk> with <unk> <unk> , And waste huge stones with little <unk> .
<unk> work &apos;st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage , Unless thou couldst return to make amends ?
One poor <unk> minute in an age Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends , <unk> him wit that to bad <unk> <unk> : O , this dread night , wouldst thou one hour come back , I could prevent this storm , and shun thy wrack !
<unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> , With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight : <unk> extremes beyond extremity , To make him curse this cursed <unk> night : Let <unk> shadows his <unk> eyes <unk> ; And the dire thought of his committed evil <unk> every bush a hideous <unk> devil .
<unk> his hours of rest with <unk> <unk> , <unk> him in his bed with <unk> groans ; Let there <unk> him pitiful <unk> , To make him moan ; but pity not his <unk> : <unk> him with <unk> &apos;d hearts , <unk> than stones ; And let mild women to him lose their <unk> , <unk> to him than <unk> in their <unk> .
<unk> him have time to tear his <unk> hair , Let him have time against himself to <unk> , Let him have time of Time &apos;s help to despair , Let him have time to live a <unk> slave , Let him have time a beggar &apos;s <unk> to crave ; And time to see one that by <unk> doth live <unk> to him <unk> <unk> to give .
<unk> him have time to see his friends his foes , And merry fools to mock at him resort ; Let him have time to mark how slow time goes In time of sorrow , and how swift and short His time of folly and his time of sport : And ever let his <unk> crime Have time to wail the <unk> of his time .
<unk> Time , thou tutor both to good and bad , <unk> me to curse him that thou taught &apos;st this ill !
At his own shadow let the thief run mad !
<unk> himself seek every hour to kill !
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should <unk> : For who so base would such an office have As <unk> <unk> to so base a slave ?
The <unk> is he , coming from a king , To shame his hope with deeds <unk> .
The <unk> man , the <unk> is the thing That makes him honour &apos;d , or <unk> him hate ; For greatest scandal <unk> on greatest state .
The moon being <unk> presently is miss &apos;d , But little stars may hide them when they list .
<unk> crow may <unk> his <unk> wings in <unk> , And <unk> fly with the <unk> away ; But if the like the <unk> <unk> desire , The stain upon his silver down will stay .
Poor <unk> are <unk> night , kings glorious day : <unk> are <unk> <unk> &apos;er they fly , But <unk> <unk> upon with every eye .
<unk> , idle words , servants to shallow fools !
<unk> sounds , weak <unk> !
<unk> yourselves in <unk> <unk> ; <unk> where leisure serves with dull <unk> ; To trembling <unk> be you <unk> : For me , I force not argument a straw , Since that my case is past the help of law .
<unk> vain I rail at <unk> , At Time , at Tarquin , and <unk> night ; In vain I <unk> with mine infamy , In vain I spurn at my confirm &apos;d despite : This <unk> smoke of words doth me no right .
The remedy indeed to do me good Is to let forth my <unk> &apos;d blood .
<unk> hand , why <unk> &apos;st thou at this <unk> ?
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame ; For if I die , my honour lives in thee ; But if I live , thou <unk> in my <unk> : Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame , And wast <unk> &apos;d to scratch her wicked foe , Kill both thyself and her for yielding so . &apos;
This said , from her <unk> couch she <unk> , To find some desperate instrument of death : But this no <unk> no <unk> <unk> , To make more vent for passage of her breath ; Which , <unk> through her lips , so <unk> As smoke from <unk> , that in air <unk> , Or that which from <unk> cannon <unk> .
<unk> vain , &apos; quoth she , &apos; I live , and seek in vain Some happy mean to end a <unk> life .
I fear &apos;d by Tarquin &apos;s <unk> to be slain , Yet for the <unk> purpose seek a knife : But when I fear &apos;d I was a loyal wife : So am I now : — O no , that cannot be ; Of that true <unk> hath Tarquin <unk> me .
<unk> !
that is gone for which I sought to live , And therefore now I need not fear to die .
To clear this <unk> by death , at least I give A <unk> of fame to slander &apos;s livery ; A dying life to living infamy ; Poor <unk> help , the treasure stolen away , To burn the guiltless casket where it lay !
<unk> , well , dear Collatine , thou shalt not know The stained taste of <unk> troth ; I will not wrong thy true affection so , To flatter thee with an <unk> oath ; This bastard <unk> shall never come to growth : He shall not boast who did thy stock <unk> That thou art doting father of his fruit .
Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought , Nor laugh with his companions at thy state ; But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought <unk> with gold , but stolen from forth thy gate .
For me , I am the mistress of my fate , And with my trespass never will <unk> , Till life to death <unk> my forced offence .
<unk> will not poison thee with my <unk> , Nor <unk> my fault in <unk> &apos;d <unk> ; My <unk> ground of sin I will not paint , To hide the truth of this false night &apos;s <unk> ; My tongue shall utter all ; mine eyes , like <unk> , As from a <unk> that feeds a <unk> , Shall <unk> pure <unk> to purge my <unk> tale . &apos;
By this ; <unk> <unk> had ended The <unk> &apos;d <unk> of her nightly sorrow , And solemn night with <unk> gait <unk> To ugly hell ; when , lo , the blushing morrow <unk> light to all fair eyes that light will borrow : But <unk> Lucrece shames herself to see , And therefore still in night would <unk> &apos;d be .
<unk> day through every <unk> spies , And seems to point her out where she sits weeping , To whom she <unk> speaks : &apos; O eye of eyes , Why <unk> thou through my window ?
leave thy <unk> ; <unk> with thy <unk> beams eyes that are sleeping : <unk> not my forehead with thy <unk> light , For day hath nought to do what &apos;s done by night . &apos;
Thus <unk> she with every thing she sees : True grief is fond and <unk> as a child , Who <unk> once , his mood with nought <unk> .
Old woes , not infant sorrows , bear them mild ; <unk> <unk> the one : the other wild , Like an <unk> &apos;d <unk> <unk> still With too much labour <unk> for want of skill .
So she , <unk> in a sea of care , <unk> <unk> with each thing she <unk> , And to herself all sorrow doth compare ; No object but her passion &apos;s strength <unk> ; And as one <unk> , another straight <unk> : Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words ; Sometime &apos; tis mad , and too much talk affords .
The little birds that tune their morning &apos;s joy Make her <unk> mad with their sweet <unk> .
For mirth doth search the bottom of <unk> ; <unk> souls are slain in merry company : <unk> best is pleas &apos;d with grief &apos;s society : True sorrow then is <unk> <unk> &apos;d When with like semblance it is <unk> &apos;d .
&apos;Tis double death to drown in <unk> of shore ; He ten times <unk> that <unk> beholding food ; To see the <unk> doth make the wound <unk> more ; Great grief grieves most at that would do it good ; <unk> woes <unk> forward like a gentle flood ; Who , being stopp &apos;d , the <unk> banks o <unk> ; <unk> <unk> with nor law nor limit knows .
<unk> mocking birds , &apos; quoth she , &apos; your <unk> <unk> Within your <unk> feather &apos;d <unk> , And in my hearing be you mute and dumb !
( My <unk> discord loves no stops nor <unk> ; A woeful hostess <unk> not merry guests : ) <unk> your nimble notes to pleasing ears ; <unk> likes <unk> when time is kept with tears .
<unk> , <unk> , that sing &apos;st of <unk> , Make thy sad grove in my <unk> &apos;d hair : As the <unk> earth weeps at thy <unk> , So I at each sad strain will strain a tear , And with deep groans the <unk> bear : For <unk> I &apos;ll <unk> on Tarquin still , While thou on <unk> <unk> &apos;st better skill .
<unk> whiles against a <unk> thou bear &apos;st thy part , To keep thy sharp woes waking , wretched I , To <unk> thee well , against my heart Will fix a sharp knife , to <unk> mine eye ; Who , if it wink , shall <unk> fall and die .
These means , as <unk> upon an instrument , Shall tune our <unk> to true <unk> .
<unk> for , poor bird , thou sing &apos;st not in the day , As <unk> any eye should thee behold , Some dark deep desert , <unk> from the way , That knows not <unk> heat nor <unk> cold , Will we find out ; and there we will unfold To creatures stern sad <unk> , to change their <unk> : Since men prove beasts , let beasts bear gentle minds . &apos;
As the poor <unk> deer , that stands at gaze , <unk> <unk> which way to fly , Or one <unk> &apos;d with a <unk> <unk> , That cannot tread the way out <unk> ; So with herself is she in mutiny , To live or die which of the twain were better , When life is sham &apos;d , and Death reproach &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> kill myself , &apos; quoth she , &apos; alack !
what were it , But with my body my poor soul &apos;s <unk> ?
They that lose half with greater patience bear it Than they whose whole is swallow &apos;d in confusion .
That mother <unk> a <unk> conclusion Who , having two sweet babes , when death takes one , Will slay the other , and be nurse to none .
<unk> body or my soul , which was the dearer , When the one pure , the other made divine ?
Whose love of either to myself was nearer ?
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine ?
Ah , me !
the bark <unk> &apos;d from the lofty pine , His leaves will wither , and his <unk> decay ; So must my soul , her bark being <unk> &apos;d away .
<unk> house is sack &apos;d , her quiet <unk> , Her <unk> <unk> &apos;d by the enemy ; Her sacred temple <unk> , spoil &apos;d , corrupted , <unk> <unk> with <unk> infamy : Then let it not be call &apos;d <unk> , If in this <unk> &apos;d <unk> I make some hole Through which I may convey this troubled soul .
<unk> die I will not till my Collatine Have heard the cause of my untimely death ; That he may vow , in that sad hour of mine , Revenge on him that made me stop my breath .
My stained blood to Tarquin I &apos;ll bequeath , Which by him tainted shall for him be spent , And as his due writ in my <unk> .
<unk> honour I &apos;ll bequeath unto the knife That wounds my body so <unk> .
&apos;Tis honour to <unk> dishonour &apos;d life ; The one will live , the other being dead : So of shame &apos;s ashes shall my fame be bred ; For in my death I <unk> shameful scorn : My shame so dead , mine honour is <unk> .
<unk> lord of that dear jewel I have lost , What <unk> shall I bequeath to thee ?
My resolution , Love , shall be thy boast , By whose example thou reveng &apos;d mayst be .
How Tarquin must be used , read it in me : Myself , thy friend , will kill myself , thy foe , And , for my sake , serve thou false Tarquin so .
<unk> brief <unk> of my will I make : My soul and body to the <unk> and ground ; My resolution , husband , do thou take ; Mine honour be the knife &apos;s that makes my wound ; My shame be his that did my fame confound ; And all my fame that lives <unk> &apos;d be To those that live , and think no shame of me .
<unk> , Collatine , shalt <unk> this will ; How was I <unk> that thou shalt see it !
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill ; My life &apos;s foul deed my life &apos;s fair end shall free it .
<unk> not , faint heart , but <unk> say &quot; so be it : &quot; Yield to my hand ; my hand shall conquer thee ; Thou dead , both die , and both shall <unk> be . &apos;
This plot of death when sadly she had laid , And <unk> &apos;d the <unk> pearl from her bright eyes , With <unk> &apos;d tongue she <unk> call &apos;d her maid , Whose swift obedience to her mistress <unk> ; For <unk> &apos;d duty with thought &apos;s feathers flies .
Poor Lucrece &apos; cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter <unk> when sun doth melt their snow .
Her mistress she doth give <unk> <unk> , With <unk> tongue , true mark of modesty , And <unk> a sad look to her lady &apos;s sorrow , ( For why her face wore sorrow &apos;s livery , ) But durst not ask of her <unk> Why her two <unk> were <unk> so , Nor why her fair cheeks <unk> &apos;d with woe .
But as the earth doth weep , the sun being set , Each flower <unk> &apos;d like a <unk> eye ; Even so the maid with swelling drops &apos; <unk> wet Her <unk> <unk> , <unk> &apos;d by <unk> Of those fair <unk> , set in her mistress &apos; sky , Who in a <unk> &apos;d ocean quench their light , Which makes the maid weep like the <unk> night .
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand , Like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : One justly weeps ; the other takes in hand No cause , but company , of her drops <unk> : Their gentle sex to weep are often willing : <unk> themselves to guess at others &apos; <unk> , And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts .
For men have marble , women <unk> minds , And therefore are they form &apos;d as marble will ; The weak <unk> &apos;d , the <unk> of strange <unk> Is form &apos;d in them by force , by <unk> , or skill : Then call them not the <unk> of their ill , No more than wax shall be <unk> evil , Wherein is stamp &apos;d the semblance of a devil .
Their <unk> , like a goodly <unk> plain , <unk> open all the little worms that creep ; In men , as in a <unk> grove , remain <unk> evils that <unk> sleep : Through crystal walls each little <unk> will peep : Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks , Poor women &apos;s faces are their own faults &apos; books .
No man <unk> against the wither &apos;d flower , But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill &apos;d !
Not that devour &apos;d , but that which doth devour , Is worthy blame .
O , let it not be <unk> Poor women &apos;s faults , that they are so <unk> &apos;d With men &apos;s <unk> !
those proud lords , to blame , Make <unk> women <unk> to their shame .
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view , <unk> &apos;d by night with <unk> strong Of present death , and shame that might <unk> By that her death , to do her husband wrong : Such danger to <unk> did belong ; The dying fear through all her body spread ; And who cannot abuse a body dead ?
By this , mild Patience bid fair Lucrece speak To the poor counterfeit of her <unk> : &apos; My girl , &apos; quoth she , &apos; on what occasion break Those tears from thee , that down thy cheeks are <unk> ?
If thou dost weep for grief of my <unk> , Know , gentle wench , it small <unk> my mood : If tears could help , mine own would do me good .
<unk> tell me , girl , when went &apos; — ( and there she stay &apos;d Till after a deep groan ) &apos; Tarquin from , hence ? &apos;
<unk> , ere I was up , &apos; <unk> the maid , &apos; The more to blame my <unk> <unk> : Yet with the fault I thus far can <unk> ; Myself was stirring ere the break of day , And , ere I rose , was Tarquin gone away .
<unk> , lady , if your maid may be so bold , She would request to know your heaviness . &apos;
<unk> peace ! &apos;
quoth Lucrece : &apos; if it should be told , The <unk> cannot make it less ; For more it is than I can well express : And that deep torture may be call &apos;d a hell , When more is felt than one hath power to tell .
<unk> , get me hither paper , ink , and pen — Yet save that labour , for I have them here .
What should I say ? — One of my husband &apos;s men Bid thou be ready , by and by , to bear A letter to my lord , my love , my dear ; Bid him with speed prepare to carry it ; The cause craves haste , and it will soon be writ . &apos;
Her maid is gone , and she <unk> to write , First <unk> o &apos;er the paper with her <unk> : <unk> and grief an <unk> combat fight ; What wit sets down is <unk> straight with will ; This is too <unk> , this blunt and ill : Much like a press of people at a door , <unk> her <unk> , which shall go before .
At last she thus begins : — &apos; Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that <unk> thee , <unk> to thy person !
next vouchsafe to afford ( If ever , love , thy Lucrece thou wilt see ) Some present speed to come and visit me : So , I commend me from our house in grief : My woes are tedious , though my words are brief . &apos;
Here <unk> she up the <unk> of her woe , Her certain sorrow writ <unk> .
By this short <unk> Collatine may know Her grief , but not her grief &apos;s true quality ; She dares not thereof make <unk> , Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse , Ere she with blood had stain &apos;d her stain &apos;d excuse .
Besides , the life and feeling of her passion She <unk> , to spend when he is by to hear her ; When sighs , and groans , and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace , the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world my might bear her .
To shun this blot , she would not blot the letter With words , till action might become them better .
To see sad sights moves more than hear them told ; For then the eye <unk> to the ear The heavy motion that it doth behold , When every part a part of woe doth bear .
&apos;Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear : <unk> sounds make lesser noise than shallow <unk> , And sorrow <unk> , being blown with wind of words .
Her letter now is seal &apos;d , and on it writ &apos; At <unk> to my lord with more than haste ; &apos; The post attends , and she <unk> it , <unk> the <unk> &apos;d groom to hie as fast As <unk> <unk> before the <unk> blast .
<unk> more than speed but dull and slow she <unk> : <unk> still <unk> such extremes .
The homely villain court <unk> to her low ; And , blushing on her , with a <unk> eye <unk> the <unk> , without or yea or no , And forth with <unk> innocence doth hie .
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie <unk> every eye <unk> their blame ; For Lucrece thought he blush &apos;d to see her shame : When , silly groom !
God wot , it was defect Of spirit , life , and bold <unk> .
Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds , while others <unk> <unk> more speed , but do it <unk> : Even so this pattern of the <unk> age <unk> &apos;d honest looks , but laid no words to gage .
His <unk> duty <unk> her mistrust , That two red fires in both their faces <unk> &apos;d ; She thought he blush &apos;d , as knowing Tarquin &apos;s lust , And , blushing with him , <unk> on him <unk> &apos;d ; Her earnest eye did make him more amaz &apos;d : The more saw the blood his cheeks <unk> , The more she thought he <unk> in her some <unk> .
But long she thinks till he return again , And yet the <unk> vassal scarce is gone .
The weary time she cannot entertain , For now &apos; tis stale to sigh , to weep , to groan : So woe hath <unk> woe , moan tired moan , That she her <unk> a little while doth stay , <unk> for means to mourn some <unk> way .
At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of <unk> painting , made for Priam &apos;s Troy ; Before the which is drawn the power of Greece , For Helen &apos;s <unk> the city to destroy , <unk> &apos;ning <unk> <unk> with <unk> ; Which the <unk> painter drew so proud , As heaven ( it seem &apos;d ) to kiss the <unk> bow &apos;d .
A thousand lamentable <unk> there , In scorn of Nature , Art gave <unk> life : Many a dry drop seem &apos;d a weeping tear , <unk> for the slaughter &apos;d husband by the wife : The red blood <unk> &apos;d , to show the painter &apos;s strife ; The dying eyes <unk> &apos;d forth their <unk> lights , Like dying <unk> burnt out in tedious nights .
There might you see the <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;d with sweat , and <unk> all with dust ; And from the <unk> of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through <unk> thrust , <unk> upon the Greeks with little lust : Such sweet observance in this work was had , That one might see those <unk> eyes look sad .
In great <unk> grace and majesty You might behold , <unk> in their faces ; In youth , quick bearing and <unk> ; And here and there the painter <unk> <unk> cowards , marching on with trembling <unk> ; Which <unk> <unk> did so well <unk> , That one would swear he saw them <unk> and tremble .
In Ajax and Ulysses , O , what art Of <unk> might one behold !
The face of either &apos; <unk> &apos;d either &apos;s heart ; Their face their manners most <unk> told : In Ajax &apos; eyes blunt rage and <unk> <unk> &apos;d ; But the mild <unk> that <unk> Ulysses lent Show &apos;d deep regard and smiling government .
There <unk> might you see grave Nestor stand , As &apos;t were <unk> the Greeks to fight ; Making such sober action with his hand That it <unk> <unk> , charm &apos;d the sight : In speech , it seem &apos;d , his beard , all silver white , <unk> &apos;d up and down , and from his lips did fly <unk> <unk> breath , which <unk> &apos;d up to the sky .
About him were a press of <unk> faces , Which seem &apos;d to swallow up his sound advice ; All <unk> <unk> , but with several graces , As if some <unk> did their ears <unk> ; Some high , some low , the painter was so nice : The <unk> of many , almost hid behind , To <unk> up higher seem &apos;d to mock the mind .
Here one man &apos;s hand lean &apos;d on another &apos;s head , His nose being shadow &apos;d by his neighbour &apos;s ear ; Here one being throng &apos;d bears back , all <unk> &apos;n and red ; Another smother &apos;d seems to <unk> and swear ; And in their rage such signs of rage they bear , As , but for loss of Nestor &apos;s golden words , It seem &apos;d they would debate with angry swords .
For much <unk> work was there ; <unk> <unk> , so compact , so kind , That for Achilles &apos; image stood his <unk> , <unk> &apos;d in an armed hand ; himself , behind , Was left unseen , save to the eye of mind : A hand , a foot , a face , a leg , a head , <unk> for the whole to be <unk> , And from the walls of <unk> Troy When their brave hope , bold Hector , march &apos;d to field , <unk> many Trojan mothers , <unk> joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons <unk> ; And to their hope they such odd action yield , That through their light joy <unk> to appear , ( Like bright things stain &apos;d ) a kind of heavy fear , And , from the <unk> of <unk> , where they fought , To <unk> &apos; <unk> banks , the red blood ran , Whose waves to <unk> the battle sought With swelling <unk> ; and their ranks began To break upon the <unk> shore , and than <unk> again , till , meeting greater ranks , They join , and shoot their <unk> at <unk> &apos; banks .
To this <unk> piece is Lucrece come , To find a face where all distress is <unk> &apos;d .
Many she sees where cares have <unk> some , But none where all distress and <unk> dwell &apos;d , Till she <unk> <unk> beheld , <unk> on Priam &apos;s wounds with her old eyes , Which bleeding under <unk> &apos; proud foot lies .
In her the painter had <unk> &apos;d Time &apos;s ruin , beauty &apos;s wrack , and grim care &apos;s reign : Her cheeks with <unk> and <unk> were <unk> &apos;d ; Of what she was no semblance did remain : Her blue blood , chang &apos;d to black in every vein , <unk> the spring that those <unk> <unk> had fed , Show &apos;d life <unk> &apos;d in a body dead .
On this sad shadow Lucrece <unk> her eyes , And shapes her sorrow to the <unk> &apos;s woes , Who nothing wants to answer her but cries , And bitter words to <unk> her cruel foes : The painter was no god to lend her those ; And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong , To give her so much grief , and not a tongue .
<unk> instrument , &apos; quoth she , &apos; without a sound , I &apos;ll tune thy woes with my <unk> tongue ; And drop sweet balm in Priam &apos;s painted wound , And rail on <unk> that hath done him wrong , And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long ; And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies .
<unk> me the strumpet that began this stir , That with my nails her beauty I may tear .
Thy heat of lust , fond Paris , did <unk> This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear ; Thy eye <unk> the fire that <unk> here : And here in Troy , for trespass of thine eye , The sire , the son , the dame , and daughter die .
<unk> should the private pleasure of some one <unk> the public plague of many <unk> ?
Let sin , alone committed , light alone Upon his head that hath <unk> so .
Let guiltless souls be <unk> from guilty woe : For one &apos;s offence why should so many fall , To plague a private sin in general ?
<unk> , here weeps <unk> , here Priam dies , Here manly Hector <unk> , here Troilus <unk> ; Here friend by friend in bloody <unk> lies , And friend to friend gives <unk> wounds , And one man &apos;s lust these many lives <unk> : Had doting Priam check &apos;d his son &apos;s desire , Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire . &apos;
Here <unk> she weeps Troy &apos;s painted woes : For sorrow , like a <unk> bell , Once set on <unk> , with his own weight goes ; Then little strength rings out the <unk> <unk> : So Lucrece set <unk> sad tales doth tell To <unk> &apos;d <unk> and colour &apos;d sorrow ; She <unk> them words , and she their looks doth borrow .
She throws her eyes about the painting round , And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament : At last she sees a wretched image bound , That piteous looks to <unk> <unk> lent : His face , though full of cares , yet show &apos;d content ; <unk> to Troy with the blunt <unk> he goes , So mild , that Patience seem &apos;d to scorn his woes .
In him the painter labour &apos;d with his skill To hide deceit , and give the harmless show An humble gait , calm looks , eyes <unk> still , A brow <unk> , that seem &apos;d to welcome woe ; <unk> neither red nor pale , but <unk> so That blushing red no guilty instance gave , Nor <unk> pale the fear that false hearts have .
But , like a constant and <unk> devil , He entertain &apos;d a show so seeming just , And therein so <unk> &apos;d his secret evil , That jealousy itself cold not mistrust <unk> craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such <unk> &apos;d storms , Or blot with <unk> sin such <unk> forms .
The <unk> &apos;d <unk> this mild image drew For perjur &apos;d <unk> , whose <unk> story The <unk> Old Priam after slew ; Whose words , like <unk> , burnt the shining glory Of <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> were sorry , And little stars shot from their fixed places , When their glass fell wherein they view &apos;d their faces .
This picture she <unk> <unk> &apos;d , And chid the painter for his wondrous skill ; <unk> , some shape in <unk> &apos;s was abus &apos;d ; So fair a form <unk> not a mind so ill : And still on him she <unk> &apos;d ; and gazing still , Such signs of truth in his plain face she <unk> , That she <unk> the picture was <unk> .
<unk> cannot be , &apos; quoth she , &apos; that so much <unk> &apos; — ( She would have said ) &apos; can <unk> in such a look ; &apos; But Tarquin &apos;s shape came in her mind the while , And from her tongue &apos; can <unk> &apos; from &apos; cannot &apos; took ; &apos; It cannot be &apos; she in that sense <unk> , And turn &apos;d it thus : &apos; It cannot be , I find , But such a face should bear a wicked mind : &apos; For even as subtle <unk> here is painted , So <unk> , so weary , and so mild , ( As if with grief or <unk> he had <unk> , ) To me came Tarquin armed ; so <unk> &apos;d With outward honesty , but yet <unk> &apos;d With inward vice : as Priam him did cherish , So did I Tarquin ; so my Troy did perish .
<unk> , look , how <unk> Priam <unk> his eyes , To see those borrow &apos;d tears that <unk> <unk> .
Priam , why art thou old and yet not wise ?
For every tear he falls a Trojan <unk> ; His eye drops fire , no water thence <unk> ; Those round clear <unk> of his that move thy pity , Are <unk> of <unk> fire to burn thy city .
<unk> devils steal effects from <unk> hell ; For <unk> in his fire doth <unk> with cold , And in that cold <unk> fire doth dwell ; These <unk> such <unk> do hold , Only to flatter fools , and make them bold ; So Priam &apos;s trust false <unk> &apos;s tears doth flatter , That he finds means to burn his Troy with water . &apos;
Here , all <unk> &apos;d , such passion her <unk> , That patience is quite beaten from her breast .
She tears the senseless <unk> with her nails , <unk> him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself <unk> ; At last she <unk> with this gives o &apos;er ; &apos; Fool , fool ! &apos;
quoth she , &apos; his wounds will not be sore . &apos;
Thus <unk> and <unk> the current of her sorrow , And time doth weary time with her <unk> .
She looks for night , and then she longs for morrow , And both she thinks too long with her <unk> : <unk> time seems long in sorrow &apos;s sharp <unk> .
Though woe be heavy , yet it seldom sleeps ; And they that watch see time how slow it <unk> .
Which all this time hath <unk> &apos;d her thought , That she with painted <unk> hath spent ; Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep <unk> of others &apos; <unk> : <unk> her woes in shows of discontent .
It <unk> some , though none it ever cur &apos;d , To think their <unk> others have <unk> &apos;d .
But now the <unk> messenger , come back , <unk> home his lord and other company ; Who finds his Lucrece <unk> in mourning black : And round about her <unk> eye <unk> <unk> stream &apos;d , like <unk> in the sky .
These <unk> in her dim <unk> <unk> new storms to those already spent .
Which when her <unk> husband saw , <unk> in her sad face he <unk> : Her eyes , though <unk> in tears , look &apos;d red and <unk> , Her <unk> colour kill &apos;d with deadly cares .
He hath no power to ask her how she fares , Both stood , like old acquaintance in a <unk> , <unk> far from home , <unk> each other &apos;s chance .
At last he takes her by the <unk> hand , And thus begins : &apos; What <unk> ill event Hath thee befall &apos;n , that thou dost trembling stand ?
Sweet love , what spite hath thy fair colour spent ?
Why art thou thus <unk> &apos;d in discontent ?
<unk> , dear dear , this <unk> heaviness , And tell thy grief , that we may give redress . &apos;
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire , Ere once she can discharge one word of woe : At length address &apos;d to answer his desire , She <unk> <unk> to let them know Her honour is ta &apos;en prisoner by the foe ; While Collatine and his <unk> lords With sad <unk> long to hear her words .
And now this pale <unk> in her watery nest <unk> the sad <unk> of her certain <unk> : &apos; <unk> words , &apos; quoth she , &apos; shall fit the trespass best , Where no excuse can give the fault <unk> : In me more woes than words are now <unk> ; And my <unk> would be drawn out too long , To tell them all with one poor tired tongue .
<unk> be this all the task it hath to say : — Dear husband , in the interest of thy bed A stranger came , and on that pillow lay Where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head ; And what wrong else may be <unk> By foul <unk> might be done to me , From that , alas !
thy Lucrece is not free .
<unk> in the dreadful dead of dark midnight , With shining <unk> in my chamber came A <unk> creature , with a <unk> light , And softly cried Awake , thou Roman dame , And entertain my love ; else lasting shame On thee and thine this night I will <unk> , If thou my love &apos;s desire do <unk> .
<unk> some <unk> &apos;d groom of thine , quoth he , Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will , I &apos;ll murder straight , and then I &apos;ll slaughter thee And swear I found you where you did <unk> The loathsome act of lust , and so did kill The <unk> in their deed : this act will be My fame and thy perpetual infamy .
<unk> this , I did begin to start and cry , And then against my heart he sets his sword , <unk> , unless I took all patiently , I should not live to speak another word ; So should my shame still rest upon record , And never be forgot in mighty Rome The <unk> death of Lucrece and her groom .
<unk> enemy was strong , my poor self weak , And far the <unk> with so strong a fear : My bloody judge <unk> my tongue to speak ; No <unk> <unk> might plead for justice there : His <unk> lust came <unk> to swear That my poor beauty had <unk> &apos;d his eyes ; And when the judge is robb &apos;d the prisoner dies .
<unk> , teach me how to make mine own excuse !
Or at the least this <unk> let me find ; Though my gross blood be stain &apos;d with this abuse , <unk> and <unk> is my mind ; That was not forc &apos;d ; that never was <unk> &apos;d To <unk> <unk> , but still pure Doth in her poison &apos;d closet yet endure . &apos;
Lo , here , the <unk> merchant of this loss , With head <unk> &apos;d , and voice <unk> &apos;d up with woe , With sad set eyes , and wretched arms <unk> , From lips <unk> pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so : But wretched as he is he <unk> in vain ; What he <unk> out his breath drinks up again .
As through an <unk> the violent roaring tide <unk> the eye that doth behold his haste ; Yet in the <unk> <unk> in his pride <unk> to the <unk> that forc &apos;d him on so fast ; In rage sent out , <unk> &apos;d in rage , being past : Even so his sighs , his sorrows make a saw .
To push grief on , and back the same grief draw .
Which <unk> woe of his poor she <unk> , And his untimely <unk> thus <unk> : &apos; Dear Lord , thy sorrow to my sorrow <unk> Another power ; no flood by <unk> <unk> .
My woe too sensible thy passion <unk> More <unk> : let it then suffice To drown one woe , one pair of weeping eyes .
<unk> for my sake , when I might charm thee so , For she that was thy Lucrece , — now attend me ; Be suddenly revenged on my foe , Thine , mine , his own : suppose thou dost defend me From what is past : the help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late , yet let the traitor die ; For <unk> justice feeds <unk> .
<unk> ere I name him , you fair lords , &apos; quoth she , ( <unk> to those that came with Collatine ) &apos; Shall plight your honourable <unk> to me , With swift pursuit to <unk> this wrong of mine ; For &apos; tis a <unk> fair design To chase <unk> with <unk> arms : Knights , by their oaths , should right poor ladies &apos; harms . &apos;
At this request , with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid , As bound in <unk> to her <unk> , <unk> to hear the hateful foe <unk> &apos;d .
But she , that yet her sad task hath not said , The <unk> stops .
<unk> , speak , &apos; quoth she , &apos; How may this forced stain be <unk> &apos;d from me ?
<unk> is the quality of mine offence , Being <unk> &apos;d with dreadful circumstance ?
May my pure mind with the foul act <unk> , My <unk> honour to advance ?
May any terms <unk> me from this chance ?
The poison &apos;d fountain <unk> itself again ; And why not I from this <unk> stain ?
With this , they all at once began to say , Her body &apos;s stain her mind <unk> <unk> ; While with a <unk> smile she turns away The face , that <unk> which deep <unk> bears Of hard <unk> , <unk> &apos;d in it with tears .
<unk> , no , &apos; quoth she , &apos; no dame , hereafter living , By my excuse shall claim excuse &apos;s giving .
Here with a sigh , as if her heart would break , She throws forth Tarquin &apos;s name : &apos; He , he , &apos; she says , But more than &apos; he &apos; her poor tongue could not speak ; Till after many <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , sick and short <unk> , She <unk> this : &apos; He , he , fair lords , &apos; tis he , That <unk> this hand to give this wound to me . &apos;
Even here she <unk> in her harmless breast A <unk> knife , that thence her soul <unk> &apos;d : That blow did bail it from the deep <unk> Of that <unk> prison where it breath &apos;d : Her <unk> sighs unto the clouds bequeath &apos;d Her <unk> <unk> , and through her wounds doth fly <unk> &apos;s lasting date from <unk> &apos;d destiny .
<unk> , <unk> &apos;d with this deadly deed , <unk> Collatine and all his <unk> <unk> ; Till Lucrece &apos; father that <unk> her bleed , <unk> on her <unk> &apos;d body threw ; And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murderous knife , and , as it left the place , Her blood , in poor revenge , held it in chase ; And <unk> from her breast , it doth divide In two slow <unk> , that the <unk> blood <unk> her body in on every side , Who , like a <unk> &apos;d island , <unk> stood <unk> and <unk> , in this fearful flood .
Some of her blood still pure and red remain &apos;d , And some look &apos;d black , and that false Tarquin stain &apos;d .
About the mourning and <unk> face Of that black blood a watery <unk> goes , Which seems to weep upon the tainted place : And ever since , as <unk> Lucrece &apos; woes , <unk> blood some watery token shows ; And blood <unk> still doth red abide , <unk> at that which is so <unk> .
<unk> , dear daughter , &apos; old <unk> cries , &apos; That life was mine which thou hast here <unk> &apos;d .
If in the child the father &apos;s image lies , Where shall I live now Lucrece is <unk> &apos;d ?
Thou wast not to this end from me <unk> &apos;d If children <unk> <unk> , We are their <unk> , and they none of ours .
<unk> broken glass , I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born ; But now that fair fresh <unk> , dim and old , <unk> me a <unk> &apos;d death by time <unk> ; O , from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn !
And <unk> &apos;d all the beauty of my glass , That I no more can see what once I was !
<unk> time , cease thou thy course and last no longer , If they <unk> to be that should <unk> .
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger , And leave the <unk> feeble souls alive ?
The old <unk> die , the young possess their <unk> : Then live , sweet Lucrece , live again , and see Thy father die , and not thy father thee ! &apos;
By this starts Collatine as from a dream , And bids <unk> give his sorrow place ; And then in <unk> Lucrece &apos; bleeding stream He falls , and <unk> the pale fear in his face , And <unk> to die with her a space ; Till manly shame bids him possess his breath , And live , to be revenged on her death .
The deep <unk> of his inward soul Hath serv &apos;d a dumb arrest upon his tongue ; Who , mad that sorrow should his use control , Or keep him from <unk> words so long , <unk> to talk ; but through his lips do throng <unk> words , so thick come in his poor heart &apos;s aid , That no man could <unk> what he said .
Yet sometime &apos; Tarquin &apos; was <unk> plain , But through his teeth , as if the name he <unk> .
This <unk> tempest , till it blow up rain , <unk> back his sorrow &apos;s tide , to make it more ; At last it <unk> , and busy winds give o &apos;er : Then son and father weep with equal strife , Who should weep most , for daughter or for wife .
The one doth call her his , the other his , Yet neither may possess the claim they lay , The father says &apos; She &apos;s mine , &apos; &apos; O , mine she is , &apos; <unk> her husband : &apos; do not take away My sorrow &apos;s interest ; let no <unk> say He weeps for her , for she was only mine , And only must be wail &apos;d by Collatine . &apos;
<unk> , &apos; quoth <unk> , &apos; I did give that life Which she too early and too late hath <unk> &apos;d . &apos;
<unk> , woe , &apos; quoth Collatine , &apos; she was my wife , I <unk> her , and &apos; tis mine that she hath kill &apos;d . &apos;
<unk> daughter &apos; and &apos; my wife &apos; with <unk> fill &apos;d The <unk> &apos;d air , who , holding Lucrece &apos; life , Answer &apos;d their cries , &apos; My daughter ! &apos;
and &apos; My wife ! &apos;
Brutus , who pluck &apos;d the knife from Lucrece &apos; side , Seeing such <unk> in their woe , <unk> to <unk> his wit in state and pride , <unk> in Lucrece &apos; wound his folly &apos;s show .
He with the Romans was <unk> so As <unk> <unk> are with kings , For <unk> words , and <unk> foolish things : But now he throws that shallow habit by , Wherein deep policy did him disguise ; And arm &apos;d his <unk> wits <unk> , To check the tears in <unk> &apos; eyes .
<unk> wronged lord of Rome , &apos; quoth he , &apos; arise ; Let my <unk> self , <unk> &apos;d a fool , Now set thy <unk> &apos;d wit to school .
<unk> , Collatine , is woe the cure for woe ?
Do wounds help wounds , or grief help grievous deeds ?
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow , For his foul act by whom thy fair wife <unk> ?
Such <unk> humour from weak minds <unk> : Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so , To slay herself , that should have slain her foe .
<unk> Roman , do not steep thy heart In such <unk> dew of <unk> , But kneel with me , and help to bear thy part , To rouse our Roman gods with <unk> , That they will suffer these <unk> , ( Since Rome herself in them doth stand <unk> &apos;d , ) By our strong arms from forth her fair streets <unk> &apos;d .
<unk> , by the Capitol that we adore , And by this chaste blood so <unk> stain &apos;d , By heaven &apos;s fair sun that breeds the fat earth &apos;s store , By all our country rights in Rome maintain &apos;d , And by chaste Lucrece &apos; soul that late complain &apos;d Her wrongs to us , and by this bloody knife , We will revenge the death of this true wife . &apos;
This said , he struck his hand upon his breast , And kiss &apos;d the fatal knife , to end his vow ; And to his <unk> urg &apos;d the rest , Who , <unk> at him , did his words allow ; Then <unk> to the ground their knees they bow ; And that deep vow , which Brutus made before , He doth again repeat , and that they swore .
When they had sworn to this advised doom , They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence ; To show her bleeding body <unk> Rome , And so to <unk> Tarquin &apos;s foul offence : Which being done with speedy <unk> , The Romans <unk> did give consent To Tarquin &apos;s everlasting banishment .

So soon was she along , as he was down , Each <unk> on their <unk> and their <unk> : <unk> Now doth she stroke his cheek , now doth he frown , And ’ <unk> to chide , but soon she stops his lips , And kissing speaks , with <unk> language broken , “ If thou wilt chide , thy lips shall never open . ” <unk> He burns with <unk> shame , she with her tears Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks ; Then with her <unk> sighs and golden hairs To fan and blow them dry again she seeks .

Even as an empty eagle , sharp by fast , <unk> with her <unk> on feathers , flesh and bone , <unk> <unk> her wings , <unk> all in haste , Till either <unk> be stuff ’ d or prey be gone : Even so she kiss ’ d his brow , his cheek , his chin , And where she ends she doth <unk> begin .

She <unk> on the <unk> , as on a prey , And calls it heavenly <unk> , air of grace , <unk> <unk> her cheeks were <unk> full of flowers So they were dew ’ d with such <unk> showers .
Look how a bird lies <unk> in a <unk> , So <unk> ’ d in her arms Adonis lies ; <unk> <unk> shame and <unk> ’ d <unk> made him <unk> , Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes : <unk> added to a river that is rank <unk> will force it <unk> the bank .

<unk> “ What am I that thou shouldst <unk> me this ?

“ Fie , <unk> picture , cold and senseless stone , <unk> <unk> , image dull and dead , <unk> <unk> <unk> but the eye alone , <unk> like a man , but of no woman bred : Thou art no man , though of a man ’ s complexion , For men will kiss even by their own direction . ” <unk> This said , impatience <unk> her <unk> tongue , And swelling passion doth provoke a pause ; <unk> cheeks and fiery eyes <unk> forth her wrong ; Being judge in love , she cannot right her cause .

These lovely <unk> , these round <unk> <unk> , Open ’ d their mouths to swallow Venus ’ liking .
<unk> Being mad before , how doth she now for wits ?
<unk> dead at first , what needs a second <unk> ?
Poor queen of love , in thine own law forlorn , To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn !
<unk> Now which way shall she turn ?

Her words are done , her woes the more <unk> ; The time is spent , her object will away , And from her <unk> arms doth urge <unk> : <unk> “ Pity , ” she cries ; “ some favour , some remorse ! ” Away he <unk> , and <unk> to his horse .
But lo from forth a <unk> that neighbours by , A breeding <unk> , lusty , young , and proud , <unk> Adonis ’ <unk> <unk> doth <unk> , And forth she rushes , <unk> and <unk> aloud : The <unk> ’ d steed , being tied unto a tree , <unk> his rein , and to her straight goes he .
<unk> <unk> he <unk> , he <unk> , he bounds , And now his <unk> <unk> he breaks asunder ; The bearing earth with his hard <unk> he wounds , Whose hollow womb <unk> like heaven ’ s thunder ; The iron <unk> he <unk> ’ <unk> his teeth , <unk> <unk> what he was <unk> with .
His ears <unk> ’ d ; his <unk> hanging <unk> Upon his compass ’ d crest now stand on end ; <unk> His <unk> drink the air , and forth again , As from a <unk> , <unk> doth he send : His eye , which <unk> <unk> like fire , <unk> his hot courage and his high desire .
<unk> Sometime he <unk> , as if he told the steps , With gentle majesty and modest pride ; Anon he <unk> upright , <unk> and <unk> , As who should say , “ Lo thus my strength is tried ; And this I do to <unk> the eye <unk> Of the fair <unk> that is standing by . ” What <unk> he his <unk> ’ s angry stir , His flattering “ <unk> ” , or his “ Stand , I say ” ?
<unk> What cares he now for curb or <unk> spur ?
For rich <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
He sees his love , and nothing else he sees , Nor nothing else with his proud sight <unk> .
<unk> Look when a painter would <unk> the life , In <unk> out a <unk> ’ d steed , His art with nature ’ s <unk> at strife , As if the dead the living should exceed : <unk> So did this horse <unk> a common one , In shape , in courage , colour , pace and bone .
<unk> ’ d , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and long , <unk> breast , full eye , small head , and <unk> wide , High crest , short ears , straight legs and passing strong , <unk> <unk> , thick tail , broad <unk> , tender hide : Look , what a horse should have he did not lack , Save a proud <unk> on so proud a back .
<unk> Sometimes he <unk> far off , and there he <unk> ; Anon he starts at stirring of a feather : To bid the wind a base he now <unk> , And where he run or fly they know not whether ; <unk> For through his <unk> and tail the high wind sings , <unk> the hairs , who <unk> like feather ’ d wings .
He looks upon his love , and <unk> unto her ; She answers him as if she knew his mind , <unk> Being proud , as <unk> are , to see him woo her , She puts on outward <unk> , seems unkind , <unk> at his love and scorns the heat he <unk> , <unk> his kind <unk> with her heels .
<unk> Then like a melancholy <unk> , He <unk> his tail that like a falling <unk> , <unk> shadow to his <unk> <unk> lent : He <unk> , and <unk> the poor flies in his <unk> .
<unk> His love , <unk> how he was <unk> ’ d , <unk> <unk> , and his fury was <unk> ’ d .
His <unk> master <unk> about to take him , When lo the <unk> ’ d <unk> , full of fear , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> doth forsake him , With her the horse , and left Adonis there : As they were mad , unto the wood they hie them , <unk> crows that strive to <unk> them .
<unk> All <unk> with <unk> , down Adonis sits , <unk> his <unk> and <unk> beast ; And now the happy season once more fits That <unk> love by <unk> may be blest ; <unk> For lovers say , the heart hath <unk> wrong , When it is <unk> ’ d the <unk> of the tongue .

<unk> He sees her coming , and begins to <unk> , Even as a dying <unk> <unk> with wind , And with his <unk> hides his angry brow , <unk> on the dull earth with <unk> mind , <unk> <unk> no notice that she is so nigh , For all <unk> he holds her in his eye .
O what a sight it was , <unk> to view How she came <unk> to the <unk> boy , <unk> To note the fighting <unk> of her hue , How white and red each other did destroy : But now her cheek was pale , and by and by It <unk> ’ d forth fire , as lightning from the sky .
<unk> Now was she just before him as he sat , And like a <unk> lover down she <unk> ; With one fair hand she <unk> up his hat , Her other tender hand his fair cheek <unk> : <unk> His tend ’ <unk> cheek <unk> her soft hand ’ s print , As apt as <unk> ’ n snow takes any <unk> .
Oh what a war of looks was then between them , Her eyes <unk> to his eyes <unk> , <unk> His eyes saw her eyes , as they had not seen them , Her eyes woo ’ d still , his eyes disdain ’ d the wooing : And all this dumb play had his acts made plain With tears , which , <unk> , her eyes did rain .
Full gently now she takes him by the hand , <unk> A lily prison ’ d in a <unk> of snow , Or <unk> in an <unk> band , So white a friend <unk> so white a foe : <unk> This beauteous combat , <unk> and <unk> , Show ’ d like two silver <unk> that sit <unk> .
Once more the <unk> of her thoughts began : “ O fairest <unk> on this mortal round , <unk> Would thou wert as I am , and I a man , My heart all whole as thine , thy heart my wound , For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee , Though nothing but my body ’ s <unk> would cure thee . ” “ Give me my hand , ” <unk> he , “ why dost thou feel it ? ” “ Give me my heart , ” <unk> she , “ and thou shalt have it .
O give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it , And being steel ’ d , soft sighs can never grave it .
<unk> Then love ’ s deep groans I never shall regard , Because Adonis ’ heart hath made mine hard . ” “ For shame , ” he cries , “ let go , and let me go , My day ’ s delight is past , my horse is gone , <unk> And ’ tis your fault I am bereft him so , I pray you hence , and leave me here alone , For all my mind , my thought , my busy care , Is how to get my <unk> from the <unk> . ” <unk> Thus she <unk> : “ Thy <unk> as he should , <unk> the warm approach of sweet desire , <unk> is a <unk> that must be cool ’ d ; Else , suffer ’ d , it will set the heart on fire , <unk> The sea hath bounds , but deep desire hath none ; Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone .
“ How like a jade he stood tied to the tree , <unk> master ’ d with a <unk> rein !
<unk> But when he saw his love , his youth ’ s fair fee , He held such petty bondage in disdain ; <unk> the base <unk> from his bending crest , <unk> his mouth , his back , his breast .

“ Let me excuse thy <unk> , gentle boy , And learn of him , I heartily beseech thee , <unk> To take advantage on presented joy , Though I were dumb , yet his proceedings teach thee .
O learn to love , the <unk> is but plain , And once made perfect , never lost again . ” <unk> “ I know not love , ” quoth he , “ nor will not know it , Unless it be a boar , and then I chase it ; ’ Tis much to borrow , and I will not owe it ; My love to love is love but to disgrace it ; <unk> For I have heard , it is a life in death , That <unk> and weeps , and all but with a breath .

And at his look she <unk> <unk> down For looks kill love , and love by looks <unk> ; <unk> A smile <unk> the <unk> of a frown ; But blessed <unk> , that by love so <unk> !
The silly boy , <unk> she is dead , <unk> her pale cheek , till <unk> makes it red .
<unk> And all amaz ’ d <unk> off his late intent , For <unk> he did think to <unk> her , Which cunning love did <unk> prevent : Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her !

He <unk> her nose , he strikes her on the cheeks , He <unk> her fingers , holds her <unk> hard , <unk> He <unk> her lips ; a thousand ways he seeks To mend the hurt that his unkindness <unk> ’ d : He kisses her ; and she , by her good will , Will never rise , so he will kiss her still .
<unk> The night of sorrow now is turn ’ d to day : Her two blue windows <unk> she <unk> , Like the fair sun when in his fresh array He <unk> the morn , and all the world <unk> : <unk> And as the bright sun <unk> the sky , So is her face <unk> ’ d with her eye .

“ O thou didst kill me ; kill me once again : Thy eyes ’ shrewd tutor , that hard heart of thine , <unk> Hath taught them <unk> tricks , and such disdain , That they have murder ’ d this poor heart of mine ; And these mine eyes , true <unk> to their queen , But for thy piteous lips no more had seen .

<unk> <unk> each <unk> subject <unk> , As when the wind <unk> ’ d in the ground , <unk> for passage , earth ’ s <unk> shakes , Which with cold terror doth men ’ s minds confound .

“ ’ Tis true , ’ tis true ; thus was Adonis slain : He ran upon the boar with his sharp <unk> , <unk> Who did not <unk> his teeth at him again , But by a kiss thought to persuade him there ; And <unk> in his <unk> , the loving <unk> <unk> ’ d <unk> the <unk> in his soft <unk> .
