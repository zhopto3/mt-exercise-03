When I perceive that men as <unk> increase , <unk> and <unk> even by the <unk> sky : <unk> in their youthful <unk> , at height <unk> , And wear their brave state out of memory .
Then the conceit of this <unk> stay , <unk> you most rich in youth before my sight , Where <unk> Time <unk> with <unk> To change your day of youth to <unk> night , And all in war with Time for love of you , As he takes from you , I <unk> you new .
<unk> But wherefore do not you a <unk> way Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time ?
And <unk> yourself in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours , And many maiden <unk> yet <unk> , With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers , Much <unk> than your painted counterfeit : So should the lines of life that life repair Which this ( Time ’ s <unk> ) or my <unk> pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live yourself in eyes of men .
To give away yourself , keeps yourself still , And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill .
<unk> Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were <unk> with your most high deserts ?
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life , and shows not half your parts : If I could write the beauty of your eyes , And in fresh numbers number all your graces , The age to come would say this poet lies , Such heavenly touches ne ’ er <unk> earthly faces .
So should my papers ( <unk> with their age ) Be <unk> , like old men of less truth than tongue , And your true rights be <unk> a poet ’ s rage , And <unk> <unk> of an antique song .
But were some child of yours alive that time , You should live twice , — in it , and in my rhyme .
<unk> Shall I compare thee to a summer ’ s day ?
Thou art more lovely and more <unk> : <unk> winds do shake the <unk> <unk> of May , And summer ’ s <unk> hath all too short a date : Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines , And often is his gold complexion <unk> , And every fair from fair sometime <unk> , By chance , or nature ’ s <unk> course <unk> : But thy eternal summer shall not <unk> , Nor lose possession of that fair thou <unk> ’ st , Nor shall death brag thou wand ’ rest in his shade , When in eternal lines to time thou grow ’ st , So long as men can breathe or eyes can see , So long lives this , and this gives life to thee .
<unk> <unk> Time blunt thou the lion ’ s <unk> , And make the earth devour her own sweet <unk> , Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger ’ s <unk> , And burn the <unk> <unk> , in her blood , Make glad and sorry <unk> as thou fleet ’ st , And do <unk> ’ er thou wilt <unk> Time To the wide world and all her <unk> sweets : But I forbid thee one most heinous crime , O <unk> not with thy hours my love ’ s fair brow , Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen , Him in thy course <unk> do allow , For beauty ’ s pattern to <unk> men .
Yet do thy worst , old Time ; despite thy wrong , My love shall in my verse ever live young .
<unk> A woman ’ s face with nature ’ s own hand painted , Hast thou the master mistress of my passion , A woman ’ s gentle heart but not acquainted With <unk> change as is false women ’ s fashion , An eye more bright than theirs , less false in <unk> : <unk> the object <unk> it <unk> , A man in hue all <unk> in his <unk> , Which steals men ’ s eyes and women ’ s souls <unk> .
And for a woman wert thou first created , Till nature as she wrought thee fell <unk> , And by addition me of thee <unk> , By <unk> one thing to my purpose nothing .
But since she <unk> thee out for women ’ s pleasure , Mine be thy love and thy love ’ s use their treasure .
<unk> So is it not with me as with that muse , <unk> by a painted beauty to his verse , Who heaven it self for ornament doth use , And every fair with his fair doth <unk> , Making a <unk> of proud compare With sun and moon , with earth and sea ’ s rich <unk> : With April ’ s <unk> flowers and all things rare , That heaven ’ s air in this huge <unk> <unk> .
O let me true in love but truly write , And then believe me , my love is as fair , As any mother ’ s child , though not so bright As those gold <unk> fixed in heaven ’ s air : Let them say more that like of <unk> well , I will not praise that purpose not to sell .
<unk> My glass shall not persuade me I am old , So long as youth and thou are of one date , But when in thee time ’ s <unk> I behold , Then look I death my days should <unk> .
For all that beauty that doth cover thee , Is but the <unk> <unk> of my heart , Which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me , How can I then be elder than thou art ?
O therefore love be of thyself so <unk> , As I not for my self , but for thee will , <unk> thy heart which I will keep so <unk> As tender nurse her babe from <unk> ill . <unk> not on thy heart when mine is slain , Thou gav ’ st me thine not to give back again .
<unk> As an <unk> <unk> on the stage , Who with his fear is put beside his part , Or some fierce thing <unk> with too much rage , Whose strength ’ s <unk> <unk> his own heart ; So I for fear of trust , forget to say , The perfect ceremony of love ’ s <unk> , And in mine own love ’ s strength seem to decay , O ’ <unk> with <unk> of mine own love ’ s might : O let my looks be then the <unk> , And dumb <unk> of my speaking breast , Who plead for love , and look for recompense , More than that tongue that more hath more <unk> .
O learn to read what silent love hath writ , To hear with eyes belongs to love ’ s fine wit .
<unk> Mine eye hath played the painter and hath <unk> , Thy beauty ’ s form in table of my heart , My body is the frame wherein ’ tis held , And <unk> it is best painter ’ s art .
For through the painter must you see his skill , To find where your true image <unk> lies , Which in my bosom ’ s <unk> is hanging still , That hath his windows <unk> with thine eyes : Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done , Mine eyes have drawn thy shape , and thine for me Are windows to my breast , <unk> the sun <unk> to peep , to gaze therein on thee ; Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art , They draw but what they see , know not the heart .
<unk> Let those who are in favour with their stars , Of public honour and proud titles boast , Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph <unk> <unk> for joy in that I honour most ; Great princes ’ <unk> their fair leaves spread , But as the <unk> at the sun ’ s eye , And in themselves their pride lies buried , For at a frown they in their glory die .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for fight , After a thousand <unk> once <unk> , Is from the book of honour <unk> quite , And all the rest forgot for which he <unk> : Then happy I that love and am beloved Where I may not remove nor be removed .
<unk> Lord of my love , to whom in <unk> Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit ; To thee I send this written <unk> To witness duty , not to show my wit .
<unk> so great , which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare , in wanting words to show it ; But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy soul ’ s thought ( all naked ) will bestow it : Till whatsoever star that <unk> my moving , <unk> on me <unk> with fair aspect , And puts apparel on my <unk> loving , To show me worthy of thy sweet respect , Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee , Till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me .
<unk> <unk> with toil , I haste me to my bed , The dear <unk> for limbs with travel tired , But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind , when body ’ s work ’ s <unk> .
For then my thoughts , from far where I abide , <unk> a <unk> pilgrimage to thee , And keep my <unk> eyelids open wide , <unk> on darkness which the blind do see .
Save that my soul ’ s <unk> sight <unk> thy shadow to my <unk> view , Which like a jewel ( hung in <unk> night ) Makes black night beauteous , and her old face new .
Lo thus by day my limbs , by night my mind , For thee , and for my self , no quiet find .
<unk> How can I then return in happy plight That am <unk> the benefit of rest ?
When day ’ s oppression is not <unk> by night , But day by night and night by day <unk> .
And each ( though enemies to either ’ s reign ) Do in consent shake hands to torture me , The one by toil , the other to complain How far I toil , still farther off from thee .
I tell the day to please him thou art bright , And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven : So flatter I the <unk> night , When <unk> stars <unk> not thou <unk> ’ st the even .
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer , And night doth nightly make grief ’ s length seem stronger <unk> When in disgrace with fortune and men ’ s eyes , I all alone <unk> my <unk> state , And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries , And look upon my self and curse my fate , <unk> me like to one more rich in hope , <unk> like him , like him with friends possessed , <unk> this man ’ s art , and that man ’ s scope , With what I most enjoy contented least , Yet in these thoughts my self almost <unk> , Haply I think on thee , and then my state , ( Like to the lark at break of day <unk> From sullen earth ) sings <unk> at heaven ’ s gate , For thy sweet love <unk> such wealth brings , That then I scorn to change my state with kings .
<unk> When to the <unk> of sweet silent thought , I <unk> up remembrance of things past , I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought , And with old woes new wail my dear time ’ s waste : Then can I drown an eye ( <unk> to flow ) For precious friends hid in death ’ s <unk> night , And weep <unk> love ’ s long since <unk> woe , And moan th ’ expense of many a <unk> sight .
Then can I grieve at <unk> <unk> , And <unk> from woe to woe tell o ’ er The sad account of <unk> moan , Which I new pay as if not paid before .
But if the while I think on thee ( dear friend ) All losses are <unk> , and sorrows end .
<unk> Thy bosom is <unk> with all hearts , Which I by <unk> have supposed dead , And there <unk> love and all love ’ s loving parts , And all those friends which I thought buried .
How many a holy and <unk> tear Hath dear religious love stol ’ n from mine eye , As interest of the dead , which now appear , But things removed that <unk> in thee lie .
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live , <unk> with the <unk> of my lovers gone , Who all their parts of me to thee did give , That due of many , now is thine alone .
Their <unk> I loved , I view in thee , And thou , all they , hast all the all of me .
<unk> If thou <unk> my <unk> day , When that <unk> death my bones with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more <unk> These poor rude lines of thy <unk> lover : <unk> them with the <unk> ’ ring of the time , And though they be <unk> by every pen , <unk> them for my love , not for their rhyme , <unk> by the height of happier men .
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought , ’ Had my friend ’ s <unk> grown with this growing age , A dearer birth than this his love had brought To march in ranks of better <unk> : But since he died and <unk> better prove , <unk> for their style I ’ ll read , his for his love ’ .
<unk> Full many a glorious morning have I seen , <unk> the mountain <unk> with sovereign eye , <unk> with golden face the <unk> green ; <unk> pale <unk> with heavenly <unk> : Anon <unk> the <unk> clouds to ride , With ugly rack on his celestial face , And from the forlorn world his visage hide <unk> unseen to west with this disgrace : Even so my sun one early morn did shine , With all <unk> <unk> on my brow , But out alack , he was but one hour mine , The region cloud hath <unk> him from me now .
Yet him for this , my love no whit <unk> , <unk> of the world may stain , when heaven ’ s sun <unk> .
<unk> Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day , And make me travel forth without my cloak , To let base clouds o ’ <unk> me in my way , <unk> thy <unk> ’ ry in their rotten smoke ?
’ Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break , To dry the rain on my <unk> face , For no man well of such a <unk> can speak , That <unk> the wound , and <unk> not the disgrace : Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief , Though thou repent , yet I have still the loss , Th ’ offender ’ s sorrow <unk> but weak <unk> To him that bears the strong offence ’ s cross .
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love <unk> , And they are rich , and ransom all ill deeds .
<unk> No more be <unk> at that which thou hast done , <unk> have thorns , and silver <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> stain both moon and sun , And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud .
All men make faults , and even I in this , <unk> thy trespass with compare , My self <unk> <unk> thy amiss , <unk> thy sins more than thy sins are : For to thy <unk> fault I bring in sense ; Thy <unk> party is thy <unk> , And ’ gainst my self a lawful <unk> <unk> : Such civil war is in my love and hate , That I an <unk> needs must be , To that sweet thief which <unk> <unk> from me .
<unk> Let me confess that we two must be twain , Although our <unk> loves are one : So shall those <unk> that do with me remain , Without thy help , by me be borne alone .
In our two loves there is but one respect , Though in our lives a <unk> spite , Which though it alter not love ’ s sole effect , Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love ’ s delight .
I may not evermore acknowledge thee , Lest my <unk> guilt should do thee shame , Nor thou with public kindness honour me , Unless thou take that honour from thy name : But do not so , I love thee in such sort , As thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
<unk> As a <unk> father takes delight , To see his <unk> child do deeds of youth , So I , made lame by Fortune ’ s dearest spite Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth .
For whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit , Or any of these all , or all , or more <unk> in thy parts , do crowned sit , I make my love <unk> to this store : So then I am not lame , poor , nor despised , Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give , That I in thy <unk> am <unk> , And by a part of all thy glory live : Look what is best , that best I wish in thee , This wish I have , then ten times happy me .
<unk> How can my muse want subject to <unk> While thou dost breathe that pour ’ st into my verse , Thine own sweet argument , too excellent , For every vulgar paper to <unk> ?
O give thyself the thanks if aught in me , Worthy <unk> stand against thy sight , For who ’ s so dumb that cannot write to thee , When thou thyself dost give invention light ?
Be thou the <unk> <unk> , ten times more in worth Than those old nine which <unk> <unk> , And he that calls on thee , let him bring forth <unk> numbers to outlive long date .
If my slight muse do please these curious days , The pain be mine , but thine shall be the praise .
<unk> O how thy worth with manners may I sing , When thou art all the better part of me ?
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring : And what is ’ t but mine own when I praise thee ?
Even for this , let us divided live , And our dear love lose name of single one , That by this <unk> I may give : That due to thee which thou deserv ’ st alone : O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove , Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave , To entertain the time with thoughts of love , Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive .
And that thou <unk> how to make one twain , By <unk> him here who doth hence remain .
<unk> Take all my loves , my love , yea take them all , What hast thou then more than thou hadst before ?
No love , my love , that thou mayst true love call , All mine was thine , before thou hadst this more : Then if for my love , thou my love <unk> , I cannot blame thee , for my love thou <unk> , But yet be <unk> , if thou thyself <unk> By <unk> taste of what thyself <unk> .
I do forgive thy <unk> gentle thief Although thou steal thee all my poverty : And yet love knows it is a greater grief To bear greater wrong , than hate ’ s known injury .
<unk> grace , in whom all ill well shows , Kill me with <unk> yet we must not be foes .
<unk> Those pretty wrongs that liberty <unk> , When I am sometime absent from thy heart , Thy beauty , and thy years full well <unk> , For still <unk> follows where thou art .
Gentle thou art , and therefore to be won , <unk> thou art , therefore to be <unk> .
And when a woman <unk> , what woman ’ s son , Will <unk> leave her till he have <unk> ?
Ay me , but yet thou mightst my seat forbear , And chide thy beauty , and thy <unk> youth , Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a <unk> truth : <unk> by thy beauty <unk> her to thee , Thine by thy beauty being false to me .
<unk> That thou hast her it is not all my grief , And yet it may be said I loved her dearly , That she hath thee is of my <unk> chief , A loss in love that touches me more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> thus I will excuse ye , Thou dost love her , because thou know ’ st I love her , And for my sake even so doth she abuse me , <unk> ’ ring my friend for my sake to approve her .
If I lose thee , my loss is my love ’ s gain , And losing her , my friend hath found that loss , Both find each other , and I lose both twain , And both for my sake lay on me this cross , But here ’ s the joy , my friend and I are one , Sweet flattery , then she loves but me alone .
<unk> When most I wink then do mine eyes best see , For all the day they view things <unk> , But when I sleep , in dreams they look on thee , And <unk> bright , are bright in dark <unk> .
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadow ’ s form , form happy show , To the clear day with thy much <unk> light , When to <unk> eyes thy shade shines so !
How would ( I say ) mine eyes be blessed made , By looking on thee in the living day , When in dead night thy fair <unk> shade , Through heavy sleep on <unk> eyes doth stay !
All days are nights to see till I see thee , And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me .
<unk> If the dull substance of my flesh were thought , <unk> distance should not stop my way , For then despite of space I would be brought , From <unk> far <unk> , where thou dost stay , No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the <unk> earth removed from thee , For nimble thought can <unk> both sea and land , As soon as think the place where he would be .
But ah , thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large <unk> of miles when thou art gone , But that so much of earth and water wrought , I must attend , time ’ s leisure with my moan .
<unk> nought by elements so slow , But heavy tears , <unk> of either ’ s woe .
<unk> The other two , slight air , and <unk> fire , Are both with thee , <unk> I abide , The first my thought , the other my desire , These <unk> with swift motion <unk> .
For when these <unk> elements are gone In tender <unk> of love to thee , My life being made of four , with two alone , <unk> down to death , <unk> with melancholy .
Until life ’ s composition be <unk> , By those swift messengers returned from thee , Who even but now come back again assured , Of thy fair health , <unk> it to me .
This told , I joy , but then no longer glad , I send them back again and straight grow sad .
<unk> Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war , How to divide the conquest of thy sight , Mine eye , my heart thy picture ’ s sight would bar , My heart , mine eye the freedom of that right , My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie , A closet never <unk> with crystal eyes ; But the <unk> doth that <unk> deny , And says in him thy fair <unk> lies .
To side this title is <unk> A <unk> of thoughts , all <unk> to the heart , And by their <unk> is <unk> The clear eye ’ s moiety , and the dear heart ’ s part .
As thus , mine eye ’ s due is thy outward part , And my heart ’ s right , thy inward love of heart .
<unk> Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took , And each doth good turns now unto the other , When that mine eye is <unk> for a look , Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother ; With my love ’ s picture then my eye doth feast , And to the painted banquet bids my heart : Another time mine eye is my heart ’ s guest , And in his thoughts of love doth share a part .
So either by thy picture or my love , Thyself away , art present still with me , For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move , And I am still with them , and they with thee .
Or if they sleep , thy picture in my sight <unk> my heart , to heart ’ s and eye ’ s delight .
<unk> How careful was I when I took my way , Each trifle under <unk> <unk> to thrust , That to my use it might <unk> stay From hands of falsehood , in sure <unk> of trust !
But thou , to whom my jewels trifles are , Most worthy comfort , now my greatest grief , Thou best of dearest , and mine only care , Art left the prey of every vulgar thief .
Thee have I not <unk> up in any <unk> , Save where thou art not , though I feel thou art , Within the gentle <unk> of my breast , From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part , And even thence thou wilt be stol ’ n I fear , For truth proves <unk> for a prize so dear .
<unk> Against that time ( if ever that time come ) When I shall see thee frown on my <unk> , When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum , <unk> to that <unk> by advised respects , Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass , And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye , When love <unk> from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity ; Against that time do I <unk> me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert , And this my hand , against my self <unk> , To guard the lawful reasons on thy part , To leave poor me , thou hast the strength of laws , Since why to love , I can <unk> no cause .
<unk> How heavy do I journey on the way , When what I seek ( my weary travel ’ s end ) Doth teach that case and that repose to say ’ Thus far the miles are <unk> from thy friend . ’ The beast that bears me , tired with my woe , <unk> <unk> on , to bear that weight in me , As if by some instinct the wretch did know His <unk> loved not speed being made from thee : The bloody spur cannot provoke him on , That sometimes anger <unk> into his hide , Which <unk> he answers with a groan , More sharp to me than <unk> to his side , For that same groan doth put this in my mind , My grief lies <unk> and my joy behind .
<unk> Thus can my love excuse the slow offence , Of my dull <unk> , when from thee I speed , From where thou art , why should I haste me thence ?
Till I return of <unk> is no need .
O what excuse will my poor beast then find , When swift extremity can seem but slow ?
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind , In <unk> speed no motion shall I know , Then can no horse with my desire keep pace , Therefore desire ( of perfect ’ st love being made ) Shall <unk> no dull flesh in his fiery race , But love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade : Since from thee going , he went <unk> , <unk> thee I ’ ll run , and give him leave to go .
<unk> So am I as the rich whose blessed key , Can bring him to his sweet <unk> treasure , The which he will not every hour survey , For <unk> the fine point of seldom pleasure .
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare , Since seldom coming in that long year set , Like stones of worth they <unk> placed are , Or captain jewels in the <unk> .
So is the time that keeps you as my <unk> Or as the <unk> which the robe doth hide , To make some special instant <unk> , By new <unk> his <unk> pride .
<unk> are you whose worthiness gives scope , Being had to triumph , being <unk> to hope .
<unk> What is your substance , whereof are you made , That <unk> of strange shadows on you tend ?
Since every one , hath every one , one shade , And you but one , can every shadow lend : <unk> Adonis and the counterfeit , Is <unk> <unk> after you , On Helen ’ s cheek all art of beauty set , And you in Grecian <unk> are painted new : Speak of the spring , and <unk> of the year , The one doth shadow of your beauty show , The other as your bounty doth appear , And you in every blessed shape we know .
In all <unk> grace you have some part , But you like none , none you for constant heart .
<unk> O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem , By that sweet ornament which truth doth give !
The rose looks fair , but fairer we it <unk> For that sweet <unk> , which doth in it live : The canker <unk> have full as deep a <unk> , As the <unk> <unk> of the roses , Hang on such thorns , and play as <unk> , When summer ’ s breath their <unk> <unk> <unk> : But for their virtue only is their show , They live <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , Die to themselves .
Sweet roses do not so , Of their sweet deaths , are sweetest <unk> made : And so of you , beauteous and lovely youth , When that shall <unk> , my verse <unk> your truth .
<unk> Not marble , nor the gilded <unk> Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme , But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than <unk> stone , <unk> with <unk> time .
When <unk> war shall <unk> <unk> , And <unk> root out the work of <unk> , Nor Mars his sword , nor war ’ s quick fire shall burn : The living record of your memory .
’ Gainst death , and <unk> enmity Shall you pace forth , your praise shall still find room , Even in the eyes of all <unk> That wear this world out to the <unk> doom .
So till the judgment that yourself arise , You live in this , and dwell in lovers ’ eyes .
<unk> Sweet love <unk> thy force , be it not said Thy edge should <unk> be than appetite , Which but to-day by feeding is <unk> , To-morrow <unk> in his former might .
So love be thou , although to-day thou fill Thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with <unk> , To-morrow see again , and do not kill The spirit of love , with a perpetual <unk> : Let this sad <unk> like the ocean be Which parts the shore , where two <unk> new , Come daily to the banks , that when they see : Return of love , more blest may be the view .
Or call it winter , which being full of care , Makes summer ’ s welcome , thrice more wished , more rare .
<unk> Being your slave what should I do but tend , Upon the hours , and times of your desire ?
I have no precious time at all to spend ; Nor services to do till you require .
Nor dare I chide the <unk> hour , Whilst I ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you , Nor think the <unk> of absence sour , When you have bid your servant once adieu .
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought , Where you may be , or your affairs suppose , But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are , how happy you make those .
So true a fool is love , that in your will , ( Though you do any thing ) he thinks no ill . <unk> That god forbid , that made me first your slave , I should in thought control your times of pleasure , Or at your hand th ’ account of hours to crave , Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure .
O let me suffer ( being at your <unk> ) Th ’ <unk> absence of your liberty , And patience tame to sufferance bide each check , Without <unk> you of injury .
Be where you list , your <unk> is so strong , That you yourself may <unk> your time To what you will , to you it doth belong , <unk> to pardon of <unk> crime .
I am to wait , though <unk> so be hell , Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well .
<unk> If there be nothing new , but that which is , Hath been before , how are our brains <unk> , Which <unk> for invention bear amiss The second <unk> of a former child !
O that record could with a backward look , Even of five hundred courses of the sun , Show me your image in some antique book , Since mind at first in character was done .
That I might see what the old world could say , To this <unk> wonder of your frame , Whether we are <unk> , or whether better they , Or whether <unk> be the same .
O sure I am the wits of former days , To subjects worse have given <unk> praise .
<unk> Like as the waves make towards the <unk> shore , So do our minutes <unk> to their end , Each <unk> place with that which goes before , In <unk> toil all <unk> do contend .
<unk> once in the main of light , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> being crowned , <unk> <unk> ’ gainst his glory fight , And Time that gave , doth now his gift confound .
Time doth <unk> the flourish set on youth , And <unk> the <unk> in beauty ’ s brow , <unk> on the <unk> of nature ’ s truth , And nothing stands but for his <unk> to <unk> .
And yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand <unk> thy worth , despite his cruel hand .
<unk> Is it thy will , thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night ?
Dost thou desire my <unk> should be broken , While shadows like to thee do mock my sight ?
Is it thy spirit that thou send ’ st from thee So far from home into my deeds to <unk> , To find out shames and idle hours in me , The scope and <unk> of thy jealousy ?
O no , thy love though much , is not so great , It is my love that keeps mine eye awake , Mine own true love that doth my rest <unk> , To play the <unk> ever for thy sake .
For thee watch I , whilst thou dost wake <unk> , From me far off , with others all too near .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> all mine eye , And all my soul , and all my every part ; And for this sin there is no remedy , It is so <unk> inward in my heart .
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine , No shape so true , no truth of such account , And for my self mine own worth do <unk> , As I all other in all <unk> <unk> .
But when my glass shows me my self indeed <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , Mine own <unk> quite contrary I read : <unk> , so <unk> were <unk> .
’ Tis thee , myself , that for myself I praise , <unk> my age with beauty of thy days .
<unk> Against my love shall be as I am now With Time ’ s <unk> hand <unk> and o ’ <unk> , When hours have <unk> his blood and <unk> his brow With lines and <unk> , when his youthful morn Hath <unk> on to age ’ s <unk> night , And all those beauties whereof now he ’ s king Are <unk> , or <unk> out of sight , <unk> away the treasure of his spring : For such a time do I now <unk> Against <unk> age ’ s cruel knife , That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love ’ s beauty , though my lover ’ s life .
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen , And they shall live , and he in them still green .
<unk> When I have seen by Time ’ s fell hand <unk> The <unk> cost of <unk> buried age , When sometime lofty <unk> I see <unk> , And brass eternal slave to mortal rage .
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain <unk> on the kingdom of the shore , And the firm soil win of the watery main , <unk> store with loss , and loss with store .
When I have seen such <unk> of State , Or state it self <unk> , to decay , <unk> hath taught me thus to <unk> : That Time will come and take my love away .
This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have , that which it fears to lose .
<unk> Since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor <unk> sea , But sad mortality o ’ <unk> their power , How with this rage shall beauty hold a <unk> , Whose action is no stronger than a flower ?
O how shall summer ’ s honey breath hold out , Against the <unk> siege of <unk> ’ ring days , When rocks <unk> are not so stout , Nor gates of steel so strong but time <unk> ?
O fearful <unk> , where alack , Shall Time ’ s best jewel from Time ’ s <unk> lie hid ?
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back , Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid ?
O none , unless this miracle have might , That in black ink my love may still shine bright .
<unk> <unk> with all these , for <unk> death I cry : As to behold desert a beggar born , And <unk> nothing <unk> in <unk> , And <unk> faith <unk> forsworn , And gilded honour <unk> <unk> , And maiden virtue <unk> <unk> , And right perfection <unk> <unk> , And strength by <unk> sway <unk> And art made <unk> by authority , And folly , <unk> , <unk> skill , And simple truth <unk> <unk> , And captive good attending captain ill .
<unk> with all these , from these would I be gone , Save that to die , I leave my love alone .
<unk> Ah wherefore with infection should he live , And with his presence grace <unk> , That sin by him advantage should <unk> , And <unk> it self with his society ?
Why should false painting <unk> his cheek , And steal dead seeming of his living hue ?
Why should poor beauty <unk> seek , <unk> of shadow , since his rose is true ?
Why should he live , now nature <unk> is , <unk> of blood to blush through <unk> veins , For she hath no <unk> now but his , And proud of many , lives upon his <unk> ?
O him she <unk> , to show what wealth she had , In days long since , before these last so bad .
<unk> Thus is his cheek the <unk> of days <unk> , When beauty lived and died as flowers do now , Before these bastard signs of fair were born , Or durst <unk> on a living brow : Before the golden <unk> of the dead , The right of <unk> , were <unk> away , To live a second life on second head , Ere beauty ’ s dead <unk> made another <unk> : In him those holy antique hours are seen , Without all ornament , it self and true , Making no summer of another ’ s green , <unk> no old to dress his beauty new , And him as for a <unk> doth Nature store , To show false Art what beauty was of <unk> .
<unk> Those parts of thee that the world ’ s eye doth view , <unk> nothing that the thought of hearts can mend : All tongues , the voice of souls , give thee that due , <unk> bare truth , even so as foes commend .
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned , But those same tongues that give thee so thine own , In other <unk> do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown .
They look into the beauty of thy mind , And that in guess they measure by thy deeds , Then <unk> their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind ) To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds : But why thy <unk> <unk> not thy show , The soil is this , that thou dost common grow .
<unk> That thou art <unk> shall not be thy defect , For slander ’ s mark was ever yet the fair , The ornament of beauty is suspect , A crow that flies in heaven ’ s sweetest air .
So thou be good , slander doth but approve , Thy worth the greater being <unk> of time , For canker vice the sweetest <unk> doth love , And thou present ’ st a pure <unk> prime .
Thou hast passed by the <unk> of young days , Either not <unk> , or <unk> being <unk> , Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise , To tie up envy , evermore <unk> , If some suspect of ill <unk> not thy show , Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe .
<unk> No longer mourn for me when I am dead , Than you shall hear the <unk> sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with <unk> worms to dwell : Nay if you read this line , remember not , The hand that writ it , for I love you so , That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot , If thinking on me then should make you woe .
O if , I say , you look upon this verse , When I ( perhaps ) <unk> am with clay , Do not so much as my poor name <unk> ; But let your love even with my life decay .
Lest the wise world should look into your moan , And mock you with me after I am gone .
<unk> O lest the world should task you to <unk> , What merit lived in me that you should love After my death , dear love , forget me quite , For you in me can nothing worthy prove .
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie , To do more for me than mine own desert , And hang more praise upon <unk> I , Than <unk> truth would willingly <unk> : O lest your true love may seem false in this , That you for love speak well of me <unk> , My name be buried where my body is , And live no more to shame nor me , nor you .
For I am <unk> by that which I bring forth , And so should you , to love things nothing worth .
<unk> That time of year thou mayst in me behold , When yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang Upon those <unk> which shake against the cold , <unk> <unk> <unk> , where late the sweet birds <unk> .
In me thou seest the <unk> of such day , As after <unk> <unk> in the west , Which by and by black night doth take away , Death ’ s second self that <unk> up all in rest .
In me thou seest the <unk> of such fire , That on the ashes of his youth doth lie , As the <unk> , whereon it must <unk> , <unk> with that which it was <unk> by .
This thou <unk> ’ st , which makes thy love more strong , To love that well , which thou must leave ere long .
<unk> But be contented when that fell arrest , Without all bail shall carry me away , My life hath in this line some interest , Which for <unk> still with thee shall stay .
When thou <unk> this , thou dost <unk> , The very part was <unk> to thee , The earth can have but earth , which is his due , My spirit is thine the better part of me , So then thou hast but lost the <unk> of life , The prey of worms , my body being dead , The coward conquest of a wretch ’ s knife , Too base of thee to be <unk> , The worth of that , is that which it <unk> , And that is this , and this with thee remains .
<unk> So are you to my thoughts as food to life , Or as <unk> showers are to the ground ; And for the peace of you I hold such strife As ’ twixt a <unk> and his wealth is found .
Now proud as an <unk> , and anon <unk> the <unk> age will steal his treasure , Now <unk> best to be with you alone , Then <unk> that the world may see my pleasure , Sometime all full with <unk> on your sight , And by and by clean <unk> for a look , <unk> or <unk> no delight Save what is had , or must from you be took .
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day , Or <unk> on all , or all away .
<unk> Why is my verse so barren of new pride ?
So far from <unk> or quick change ?
Why with the time do I not <unk> aside To <unk> <unk> , and to <unk> strange ?
Why write I still all one , ever the same , And keep invention in a noted weed , That every word doth almost tell my name , <unk> their birth , and where they did proceed ?
O know sweet love I always write of you , And you and love are still my argument : So all my best is <unk> old words new , <unk> again what is already spent : For as the sun is daily new and old , So is my love still telling what is told .
<unk> Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear , Thy <unk> how thy precious minutes waste , These <unk> leaves thy mind ’ s <unk> will bear , And of this book , this learning mayst thou taste .
The <unk> which thy glass will truly show , Of <unk> graves will give thee memory , Thou by thy <unk> ’ s <unk> <unk> mayst know , Time ’ s <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
Look what thy memory cannot contain , <unk> to these waste <unk> , and thou shalt find Those children <unk> , delivered from thy brain , To take a new acquaintance of thy mind .
These offices , so oft as thou wilt look , Shall profit thee , and much enrich thy book .
<unk> So oft have I <unk> thee for my muse , And found such fair assistance in my verse , As every <unk> pen hath got my use , And under thee their <unk> <unk> .
Thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing , And heavy ignorance aloft to fly , Have added feathers to the learned ’ s wing , And given grace a double majesty .
Yet be most proud of that which I <unk> , Whose <unk> is thine , and born of thee , In others ’ works thou dost but mend the style , And <unk> with thy sweet graces <unk> be .
But thou art all my art , and dost advance As high as learning , my rude ignorance .
<unk> Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid , My verse alone had all thy gentle grace , But now my gracious numbers are <unk> , And my sick muse doth give an other place .
I grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> pen , Yet what of thee thy poet doth <unk> , He <unk> thee of , and pays it thee again , He <unk> thee virtue , and he stole that word , From thy behaviour , beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek : he can afford No praise to thee , but what in thee doth live .
Then thank him not for that which he doth say , Since what he owes thee , thou thyself dost pay .
<unk> O how I faint when I of you do write , Knowing a better spirit doth use your name , And in the praise thereof <unk> all his might , To make me <unk> speaking of your fame .
But since your <unk> , wide as the ocean is , The humble as the <unk> sail doth bear , My saucy bark ( <unk> far to his ) On your broad main doth <unk> appear .
Your <unk> help will hold me up <unk> , Whilst he upon your <unk> deep doth ride , Or ( being <unk> ) I am a worthless <unk> , He of tall <unk> , and of goodly pride .
Then if he thrive and I be cast away , The worst was this : my love was my decay .
<unk> Or I shall live your <unk> to make , Or you <unk> when I in earth am rotten , From hence your memory death cannot take , Although in me each part will be forgotten .
Your name from hence immortal life shall have , Though I ( once gone ) to all the world must die , The earth can yield me but a common grave , When you <unk> in men ’ s eyes shall lie , Your monument shall be my gentle verse , Which eyes not yet created shall o ’ <unk> , And tongues to be , your being shall <unk> , When all the <unk> of this world are dead , You still shall live , such virtue hath my pen , Where breath most <unk> , even in the mouths of men .
<unk> I grant thou wert not married to my muse , And therefore mayst without <unk> o ’ <unk> The <unk> words which <unk> use Of their fair subject , blessing every book .
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue , <unk> thy worth a limit past my praise , And therefore art enforced to seek <unk> , Some <unk> stamp of the <unk> days .
And do so love , yet when they have <unk> , What <unk> touches <unk> can lend , Thou truly fair , wert truly <unk> , In true plain words , by thy <unk> friend .
And their gross painting might be better used , Where cheeks need blood , in thee it is abused .
<unk> I never saw that you did painting need , And therefore to your fair no painting set , I found ( or thought I found ) you did exceed , That barren tender of a poet ’ s debt : And therefore have I slept in your report , That you yourself being <unk> well might show , How far a <unk> <unk> doth come too short , <unk> of worth , what worth in you doth grow .
This silence for my sin you did <unk> , Which shall be most my glory being dumb , For I <unk> not beauty being mute , When others would give life , and bring a tomb .
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes , Than both your <unk> can in praise devise .
<unk> Who is it that says most , which can say more , Than this rich praise : that you alone are you , In whose confine <unk> is the store , Which should example where your equal grew .
<unk> <unk> within that pen doth dwell , That to his subject <unk> not some small glory , But he that writes of you , if he can tell , That you are you , so <unk> his story .
Let him but copy what in you is writ , Not making worse what nature made so clear , And such a <unk> shall fame his wit , Making his style <unk> every where .
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse , Being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse .
<unk> My <unk> muse in manners holds her still , While <unk> of your praise <unk> <unk> , <unk> their character with golden <unk> , And precious phrase by all the <unk> <unk> .
I think good thoughts , whilst other write good words , And like <unk> clerk still cry Amen , To every <unk> that able spirit affords , In <unk> form of well <unk> pen .
<unk> you praised , I say ’ tis so , ’ tis true , And to the most of praise add something more , But that is in my thought , whose love to you ( Though words come <unk> ) holds his rank before , Then others , for the breath of words respect , Me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect .
<unk> Was it the proud full sail of his great verse , <unk> for the prize of ( all too precious ) you , That did my ripe thoughts in my brain <unk> , Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew ?
Was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write , Above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead ?
No , neither he , nor his <unk> by night Giving him aid , my verse <unk> .
He nor that <unk> familiar ghost Which nightly <unk> him with intelligence , As <unk> of my silence cannot boast , I was not sick of any fear from thence .
But when your countenance <unk> up his line , Then <unk> I matter , that <unk> mine .
<unk> Farewell !
thou art too dear for my <unk> , And like enough thou know ’ st thy <unk> , The <unk> of thy worth gives thee <unk> : My bonds in thee are all <unk> .
For how do I hold thee but by thy <unk> , And for that riches where is my deserving ?
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting , And so my <unk> back again is <unk> .
Thyself thou gav ’ st , thy own worth then not knowing , Or me to whom thou gav ’ st it , else <unk> , So thy great gift upon <unk> growing , Comes home again , on better judgement making .
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter , In sleep a king , but waking no such matter .
<unk> When thou shalt be <unk> to set me light , And place my merit in the eye of scorn , Upon thy side , against my self I ’ ll fight , And prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn : With mine own weakness being best acquainted , Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults <unk> , wherein I am <unk> : That thou in losing me , shalt win much glory : And I by this will be a <unk> too , For bending all my loving thoughts on thee , The injuries that to my self I do , <unk> thee vantage , <unk> me .
Such is my love , to thee I so belong , That for thy right , my self will bear all wrong .
<unk> Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault , And I will <unk> upon that offence , Speak of my <unk> , and I straight will <unk> : Against thy reasons making no defence .
Thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill , To set a form upon desired change , As I ’ ll my self disgrace , knowing thy will , I will acquaintance <unk> and look strange : Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue , Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell , Lest I , too much profane , should do it wrong , And haply of our old acquaintance tell .
For thee , against my self I ’ ll vow debate , For I must ne ’ er love him whom thou dost hate .
<unk> Then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now , Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross , join with the spite of fortune , make me bow , And do not drop in for an <unk> : Ah do not , when my heart hath ’ <unk> this sorrow , Come in the <unk> of a <unk> woe , Give not a <unk> night a <unk> morrow , To <unk> out a <unk> overthrow .
If thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last , When other petty griefs have done their spite , But in the <unk> come , so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortune ’ s might .
And other <unk> of woe , which now seem woe , <unk> with loss of thee , will not seem so .
<unk> Some glory in their birth , some in their skill , Some in their wealth , some in their body ’ s force , Some in their garments though <unk> ill : Some in their <unk> and hounds , some in their horse .
And every humour hath his <unk> pleasure , Wherein it finds a joy above the rest , But these <unk> are not my measure , All these I better in one general best .
Thy love is better than high birth to me , <unk> than wealth , <unk> than garments ’ <unk> , Of more delight than <unk> and horses be : And having thee , of all men ’ s pride I boast .
<unk> in this alone , that thou mayst take , All this away , and me most wretched make .
<unk> But do thy worst to steal thyself away , For term of life thou art assured mine , And life no longer than thy love will stay , For it <unk> upon that love of thine .
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs , When in the least of them my life hath end , I see , a better state to me belongs Than that , which on thy humour doth depend .
Thou canst not vex me with <unk> mind , Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie , O what a happy title do I find , Happy to have thy love , happy to die !
But what ’ s so <unk> that fears no blot ?
Thou mayst be false , and yet I know it not .
<unk> So shall I live , <unk> thou art true , Like a deceived husband , so love ’ s face , May still seem love to me , though <unk> new : Thy looks with me , thy heart in other place .
For there can live no hatred in thine eye , Therefore in that I cannot know thy change , In many ’ s looks , the false heart ’ s history Is writ in <unk> and frowns and <unk> strange .
But heaven in thy <unk> did <unk> , That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell , Whate ’ er thy thoughts , or thy heart ’ s <unk> be , Thy looks should nothing thence , but <unk> tell .
How like <unk> ’ s <unk> doth thy beauty grow , If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show .
<unk> They that have power to hurt , and will do none , That do not do the thing , they most do show , Who moving others , are themselves as stone , <unk> , cold , and to <unk> slow : They rightly do inherit heaven ’ s graces , And husband nature ’ s riches from expense , They are the lords and <unk> of their faces , <unk> , but <unk> of their excellence : The summer ’ s flower is to the summer sweet , Though to it self , it only live and die , But if that flower with base infection meet , The <unk> weed <unk> his dignity : For sweetest things turn <unk> by their deeds , <unk> that <unk> , smell far worse than weeds .
<unk> How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame , Which like a canker in the <unk> rose , Doth <unk> the beauty of thy <unk> name !
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins <unk> !
That tongue that tells the story of thy days , ( Making <unk> <unk> on thy sport ) Cannot <unk> , but in a kind of praise , <unk> thy name , <unk> an ill report .
O what a <unk> have those <unk> got , Which for their <unk> chose out thee , Where beauty ’ s <unk> doth cover every blot , And all things turns to fair , that eyes can see !
Take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege , The <unk> knife <unk> doth lose his edge .
<unk> Some say thy fault is youth , some <unk> , Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport , Both grace and faults are loved of more and less : Thou mak ’ st faults graces , that to thee resort : As on the finger of a <unk> queen , The <unk> jewel will be well <unk> : So are those <unk> that in thee are seen , To <unk> <unk> , and for true things <unk> .
How many <unk> might the stern wolf betray , If like a lamb he could his looks <unk> !
How many <unk> mightst thou lead away , if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state !
But do not so , I love thee in such sort , As thou being mine , mine is thy good report .
<unk> How like a winter hath my absence been From thee , the pleasure of the <unk> year !
What <unk> have I felt , what dark days seen !
What old <unk> ’ s <unk> everywhere !
And yet this time removed was summer ’ s time , The <unk> <unk> big with rich increase , <unk> the wanton burden of the prime , Like <unk> <unk> after their lords ’ <unk> : Yet this <unk> issue <unk> to me But hope of <unk> , and <unk> fruit , For summer and his pleasures wait on thee , And thou away , the very birds are mute .
Or if they sing , ’ tis with so dull a cheer , That leaves look pale , <unk> the winter ’ s near .
<unk> From you have I been absent in the spring , When <unk> April ( <unk> in all his trim ) Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing : That heavy <unk> <unk> and <unk> with him .
Yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell Of <unk> flowers in <unk> and in hue , Could make me any summer ’ s story tell : Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew : Nor did I wonder at the lily ’ s white , Nor praise the deep <unk> in the rose , They were but sweet , but figures of delight : <unk> after you , you pattern of all those .
Yet <unk> it winter still , and you away , As with your shadow I with these did play .
<unk> The forward <unk> thus did I chide , Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that <unk> , If not from my love ’ s breath ?
The purple pride Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells , In my love ’ s veins thou hast too grossly <unk> .
The lily I condemned for thy hand , And <unk> of <unk> had stol ’ n thy hair , The roses <unk> on thorns did stand , One blushing shame , another white despair : A third nor red , nor white , had stol ’ n of both , And to his <unk> had <unk> thy breath , But for his theft in pride of all his growth A <unk> canker eat him up to death .
More flowers I noted , yet I none could see , But sweet , or colour it had stol ’ n from thee .
<unk> Where art thou <unk> that thou forget ’ st so long , To speak of that which gives thee all thy might ?
<unk> ’ st thou thy fury on some worthless song , <unk> thy power to lend base subjects light ?
Return <unk> <unk> , and straight redeem , In gentle numbers time so idly spent , Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem , And gives thy pen both skill and argument .
Rise <unk> <unk> , my love ’ s sweet face survey , If time have any <unk> <unk> there , If any , be a <unk> to decay , And make time ’ s <unk> despised everywhere .
Give my love fame faster than Time <unk> life , So thou prevent ’ st his <unk> , and crooked knife .
<unk> O <unk> <unk> what shall be thy amends , For thy neglect of truth in beauty <unk> ?
Both truth and beauty on my love <unk> : So dost thou too , and therein <unk> : Make answer <unk> , wilt thou not haply say , ’ <unk> needs no colour with his colour fixed , Beauty no <unk> , beauty ’ s truth to lay : But best is best , if never <unk> ’ ?
Because he needs no praise , wilt thou be dumb ?
<unk> not silence so , for ’ t lies in thee , To make him much outlive a gilded tomb : And to be praised of <unk> yet to be .
Then do thy office <unk> , I teach thee how , To make him seem long hence , as he shows now .
<unk> My love is <unk> though more weak in seeming , I love not less , though less the show appear , That love is <unk> , whose rich <unk> , The owner ’ s tongue doth <unk> every where .
Our love was new , and then but in the spring , When I was wont to greet it with my lays , As <unk> in summer ’ s front doth sing , And stops her <unk> in growth of <unk> days : Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her <unk> <unk> did hush the night , But that wild music <unk> every <unk> , And sweets grown common lose their dear delight .
Therefore like her , I sometime hold my tongue : Because I would not dull you with my song .
<unk> Alack what poverty my muse brings forth , That having such a scope to show her pride , The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside .
O blame me not if I no more can write !
Look in your glass and there appears a face , That <unk> my blunt invention quite , <unk> my lines , and doing me disgrace .
Were it not <unk> then <unk> to mend , To mar the subject that before was well ?
For to no other pass my verses tend , Than of your graces and your gifts to tell .
And more , much more than in my verse can sit , Your own glass shows you , when you look in it .
<unk> To me fair friend you never can be old , For as you were when first your eye I <unk> , Such seems your beauty still : three <unk> cold , Have from the <unk> shook three <unk> ’ pride , Three beauteous <unk> to yellow <unk> turned , In process of the <unk> have I seen , Three April <unk> in three hot <unk> <unk> , Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green .
Ah yet doth beauty like a <unk> hand , <unk> from his figure , and no pace <unk> , So your sweet hue , which methinks still doth stand Hath motion , and mine eye may be deceived .
For fear of which , hear this thou age <unk> , Ere you were born was beauty ’ s summer dead .
<unk> Let not my love be called <unk> , Nor my beloved as an <unk> show , Since all alike my songs and praises be To one , of one , still such , and ever so .
<unk> is my love to-day , to-morrow kind , Still constant in a wondrous excellence , Therefore my verse to constancy <unk> , One thing <unk> , leaves out difference .
Fair , kind , and true , is all my argument , Fair , kind , and true , <unk> to other words , And in this change is my invention spent , Three <unk> in one , which wondrous scope affords .
Fair , kind , and true , have often lived alone .
Which three till now , never kept seat in one .
<unk> When in the <unk> of wasted time , I see <unk> of the fairest <unk> , And beauty making beautiful old rhyme , In praise of ladies dead , and lovely knights , Then in the <unk> of sweet beauty ’ s best , Of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow , I see their antique pen would have <unk> , Even such a beauty as you master now .
So all their praises are but <unk> Of this our time , all you <unk> , And for they looked but with <unk> eyes , They had not skill enough your worth to sing : For we which now behold these present days , Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise .
<unk> Not mine own fears , nor the <unk> soul , Of the wide world , <unk> on things to come , Can yet the <unk> of my true love control , <unk> as forfeit to a <unk> doom .
The mortal moon hath her <unk> <unk> , And the sad <unk> mock their own <unk> , <unk> now crown themselves assured , And peace <unk> <unk> of <unk> age .
Now with the drops of this most <unk> time , My love looks fresh , and death to me <unk> , Since spite of him I ’ ll live in this poor rhyme , While he <unk> o ’ er dull and <unk> <unk> .
And thou in this shalt find thy monument , When <unk> ’ <unk> and <unk> of brass are spent .
<unk> What ’ s in the brain that ink may character , Which hath not <unk> to thee my true spirit , What ’ s new to speak , what now to <unk> , That may express my love , or thy dear merit ?
Nothing sweet boy , but yet like prayers divine , I must each day say o ’ er the very same , <unk> no old thing old , thou mine , I thine , Even as when first I <unk> thy fair name .
So that eternal love in love ’ s fresh case , <unk> not the dust and injury of age , Nor gives to necessary <unk> place , But makes <unk> for aye his page , <unk> the first conceit of love there bred , Where time and outward form would show it dead .
<unk> O never say that I was false of heart , Though absence <unk> my flame to <unk> , As easy might I from my self depart , As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie : That is my home of love , if I have <unk> , Like him that <unk> I return again , Just to the time , not with the time <unk> , So that my self bring water for my stain , Never believe though in my nature <unk> , All <unk> that <unk> all <unk> of blood , That it could so <unk> be stained , To leave for nothing all thy sum of good : For nothing this wide <unk> I call , Save thou my rose , in it thou art my all .
<unk> Alas ’ tis true , I have gone here and there , And made my self a <unk> to the view , <unk> mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear , Made old offences of affections new .
Most true it is , that I have looked on truth <unk> and strangely : but by all above , These <unk> gave my heart another youth , And worse <unk> proved thee my best of love .
Now all is done , have what shall have no end , Mine appetite I never more will <unk> On <unk> proof , to try an <unk> friend , A god in love , to whom I am <unk> .
Then give me welcome , next my heaven the best , Even to thy pure and most most loving breast .
<unk> O for my sake do you with Fortune chide , The guilty goddess of my <unk> deeds , That did not better for my life provide , Than public means which public manners breeds .
<unk> comes it that my name <unk> a <unk> , And almost thence my nature is <unk> To what it works in , like the <unk> ’ s hand : Pity me then , and wish I were <unk> , Whilst like a willing patient I will drink , <unk> of <unk> ’ gainst my strong infection , No <unk> that I will bitter think , Nor double penance to <unk> correction .
Pity me then dear friend , and I assure ye , Even that your pity is enough to cure me .
<unk> Your love and pity doth th ’ <unk> fill , Which vulgar scandal <unk> upon my brow , For what care I who calls me well or ill , So you o ’ <unk> my bad , my good allow ?
You are my all the world , and I must strive , To know my shames and praises from your tongue , None else to me , nor I to none alive , That my <unk> sense or changes right or wrong .
In so profound <unk> I throw all care Of others ’ voices , that my <unk> ’ s sense , To <unk> and to flatterer <unk> are : Mark how with my neglect I do <unk> .
You are so strongly in my purpose bred , That all the world besides methinks are dead .
<unk> Since I left you , mine eye is in my mind , And that which <unk> me to go about , Doth part his function , and is partly blind , <unk> seeing , but <unk> is out : For it no form <unk> to the heart Of bird , of flower , or shape which it doth <unk> , Of his quick <unk> hath the mind no part , Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch : For if it see the <unk> ’ st or <unk> sight , The most sweet favour or <unk> ’ st creature , The mountain , or the sea , the day , or night : The crow , or dove , it shapes them to your feature .
<unk> of more , <unk> with you , My most true mind thus <unk> mine <unk> .
<unk> Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you <unk> up the monarch ’ s plague this flattery ?
Or whether shall I say mine eye <unk> true , And that your love taught it this <unk> ?
To make of <unk> , and things <unk> , Such <unk> as your sweet self <unk> , <unk> every bad a perfect best As fast as <unk> to his beams <unk> : O ’ tis the first , ’ tis flattery in my seeing , And my great mind most kingly drinks it up , Mine eye well knows what with his <unk> is ’ <unk> , And to his <unk> doth prepare the cup .
If it be <unk> , ’ tis the lesser sin , That mine eye loves it and doth first begin .
<unk> Those lines that I before have writ do lie , Even those that said I could not love you dearer , Yet then my judgment knew no reason why , My most full flame should afterwards burn <unk> , But reckoning time , whose <unk> <unk> <unk> in ’ twixt vows , and change <unk> of kings , <unk> sacred beauty , blunt the sharp ’ st intents , <unk> strong minds to the course of <unk> ’ ring things : Alas why fearing of time ’ s tyranny , Might I not then say ‘ Now I love you best , ’ When I was certain o ’ er <unk> , <unk> the present , <unk> of the rest ?
Love is a babe , then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still doth grow .
<unk> Let me not to the marriage of true minds <unk> <unk> , love is not love Which <unk> when it <unk> finds , Or <unk> with the <unk> to remove .
O no , it is an <unk> mark That looks on <unk> and is never <unk> ; It is the star to every wand ’ ring bark , Whose worth ’ s unknown , although his height be taken .
Love ’ s not Time ’ s fool , though <unk> lips and cheeks Within his bending <unk> ’ s compass come , Love <unk> not with his brief hours and <unk> , But bears it out even to the edge of doom : If this be error and upon me proved , I never writ , nor no man ever loved .
<unk> <unk> me thus , that I have <unk> all , Wherein I should your great deserts <unk> , <unk> upon your dearest love to call , Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day , That I have <unk> been with unknown minds , And given to time your own <unk> right , That I have <unk> sail to all the winds Which should <unk> me <unk> from your sight .
<unk> both my <unk> and <unk> down , And on just proof <unk> , <unk> , Bring me within the level of your frown , But shoot not at me in your <unk> hate : Since my appeal says I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love .
<unk> Like as to make our appetite more keen With <unk> <unk> we our <unk> urge , As to prevent our <unk> unseen , We <unk> to shun sickness when we purge .
Even so being full of your ne ’ <unk> <unk> , To bitter <unk> did I frame my feeding ; And sick of <unk> found a kind of <unk> , To be <unk> ere that there was true <unk> .
Thus policy in love t ’ <unk> The <unk> that were not , grew to faults assured , And brought to medicine a <unk> state Which rank of goodness would by ill be <unk> .
But thence I learn and find the <unk> true , <unk> poison him that so fell sick of you .
<unk> What <unk> have I drunk of <unk> tears <unk> from <unk> foul as hell within , <unk> fears to hopes , and hopes to fears , Still losing when I saw my self to win !
What wretched <unk> hath my heart committed , Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never !
How have mine eyes out of their <unk> been <unk> In the <unk> of this <unk> fever !
O benefit of ill , now I find true That better is , by evil still made better .
And <unk> love when it is built <unk> <unk> fairer than at first , more strong , far greater .
So I return <unk> to my content , And gain by <unk> thrice more than I have spent .
<unk> That you were once unkind <unk> me now , And for that sorrow , which I then did feel , <unk> must I under my <unk> bow , Unless my <unk> were brass or <unk> steel .
For if you were by my unkindness <unk> As I by yours , y ’ have passed a hell of time , And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime .
O that our night of woe might have <unk> My <unk> sense , how hard true sorrow <unk> , And soon to you , as you to me then <unk> The humble <unk> , which wounded bosoms fits !
But that your trespass now becomes a fee , Mine <unk> yours , and yours must ransom me .
<unk> ’ Tis better to be vile than vile <unk> , When not to be , <unk> reproach of being , And the just pleasure lost , which is so <unk> , Not by our feeling , but by others ’ seeing .
For why should others ’ false <unk> eyes Give <unk> to my <unk> blood ?
Or on my <unk> why are <unk> spies , Which in their wills count bad what I think good ?
No , I am that I am , and they that level At my <unk> , <unk> up their own , I may be straight though they themselves be <unk> ; By their rank thoughts , my deeds must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain , All men are bad and in their <unk> reign .
<unk> Thy gift , thy <unk> , are within my brain Full <unk> with lasting memory , Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to <unk> .
Or at the least , so long as brain and heart Have <unk> by nature to <unk> , Till each to <unk> oblivion yield his part Of thee , thy record never can be <unk> : That poor <unk> could not so much hold , Nor need I <unk> thy dear love to score , Therefore to give them from me was I bold , To trust those <unk> that receive thee more : To keep an <unk> to remember thee Were to import <unk> in me .
<unk> No !
Time , thou shalt not boast that I do change , Thy <unk> built up with <unk> might To me are nothing <unk> , nothing strange , They are but <unk> of a former sight : Our <unk> are brief , and therefore we <unk> , What thou dost <unk> upon us that is old , And rather make them born to our desire , Than think that we before have heard them told : Thy <unk> and thee I both defy , Not <unk> ’ ring at the present , nor the past , For thy <unk> , and what we see doth lie , Made more or less by thy <unk> haste : This I do vow and this shall ever be , I will be true despite thy <unk> and thee .
<unk> If my dear love were but the child of state , It might for Fortune ’ s bastard be <unk> , As subject to time ’ s love or to time ’ s hate , <unk> among weeds , or flowers with flowers <unk> .
No it was <unk> far from accident , It <unk> not in smiling pomp , nor falls Under the blow of <unk> discontent , Whereto th ’ <unk> time our fashion calls : It fears not policy that <unk> , Which works on <unk> of <unk> hours , But all alone stands <unk> politic , That it nor grows with heat , nor <unk> with showers .
To this I witness call the fools of time , Which die for goodness , who have lived for crime .
<unk> Were ’ t aught to me I bore the <unk> , With my <unk> the outward <unk> , Or laid great <unk> for <unk> , Which proves more short than waste or <unk> ?
Have I not seen <unk> on form and favour <unk> all , and more by <unk> too much <unk> For compound sweet ; <unk> simple <unk> , <unk> <unk> in their gazing spent ?
No , let me be <unk> in thy heart , And take thou my <unk> , poor but free , Which is not <unk> with <unk> , knows no art , But mutual render , only me for thee .
Hence , thou <unk> <unk> , a true soul When most <unk> , stands least in thy control .
<unk> O thou my lovely boy who in thy power , Dost hold Time ’ s <unk> glass his <unk> hour : Who hast by <unk> grown , and therein show ’ st , Thy lovers <unk> , as thy sweet self grow ’ st .
If Nature ( sovereign mistress over wrack ) As thou <unk> <unk> still will pluck thee back , She keeps thee to this purpose , that her skill May time disgrace , and wretched minutes kill .
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure , She may <unk> , but not still keep her treasure !
Her <unk> ( though <unk> ) answered must be , And her <unk> is to render thee .
<unk> In the old age black was not <unk> fair , Or if it were it bore not beauty ’ s name : But now is black beauty ’ s <unk> heir , And beauty <unk> with a bastard shame , For since each hand hath put on nature ’ s power , <unk> the foul with art ’ s false borrowed face , Sweet beauty hath no name , no holy <unk> , But is <unk> , if not lives in disgrace .
Therefore my mistress ’ eyes are raven black , Her eyes so <unk> , and they <unk> seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack , <unk> <unk> with a false esteem , Yet so they mourn <unk> of their woe , That every tongue says beauty should look so .
<unk> How oft when thou , my music , music play ’ st , Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway ’ st The <unk> <unk> that mine ear <unk> , Do I envy those <unk> that nimble leap , To kiss the tender inward of thy hand , Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap , At the wood ’ s <unk> by thee blushing stand .
To be so <unk> they would change their state And <unk> with those dancing <unk> , O ’ er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait , Making dead wood more blest than living lips , Since saucy <unk> so happy are in this , Give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss .
<unk> Th ’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action , and till action , lust Is <unk> , <unk> ’ rous , bloody full of blame , <unk> , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust , <unk> no sooner but despised straight , <unk> reason <unk> , and no sooner had <unk> reason hated as a <unk> bait , On purpose laid to make the <unk> mad .
<unk> in pursuit and in possession so , Had , having , and in <unk> , to have extreme , A bliss in proof , and proved , a very woe ; Before a joy <unk> behind a dream .
All this the world well knows yet none knows well , To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .
<unk> My mistress ’ eyes are nothing like the sun , <unk> is far more red , than her lips red , If snow be white , why then her <unk> are <unk> : If hairs be <unk> , black <unk> grow on her head : I have seen roses <unk> , red and white , But no such roses see I in her cheeks , And in some <unk> is there more delight , Than in the breath that from my mistress <unk> .
I love to hear her speak , yet well I know , That music hath a far more pleasing sound : I grant I never saw a goddess go ; My mistress when she walks <unk> on the ground .
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare , As any she <unk> with false compare .
<unk> Thou art as <unk> , so as thou art , As those whose beauties <unk> make them cruel ; For well thou know ’ st to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel .
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold , Thy face hath not the power to make love groan ; To say they <unk> , I dare not be so bold , Although I swear it to my self alone .
And to be sure that is not false I swear , A thousand groans but thinking on thy face , One on another ’ s neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgment ’ s place .
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds , And thence this slander as I think <unk> .
<unk> Thine eyes I love , and they as <unk> me , Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain , Have put on black , and loving <unk> be , <unk> with pretty <unk> upon my pain .
And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east , Nor that full star that <unk> in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face : O let it then as well <unk> thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace , And suit thy pity like in every part .
Then will I swear beauty herself is black , And all they foul that thy complexion lack .
<unk> Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me ; Is ’ t not enough to torture me alone , But slave to <unk> my sweet ’ st friend must be ?
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken , And my next self thou <unk> hast <unk> , Of him , my self , and thee I am <unk> , A torment thrice <unk> thus to be <unk> : <unk> my heart in thy steel bosom ’ s ward , But then my friend ’ s heart let my poor heart bail , <unk> ’ er keeps me , let my heart be his guard , Thou canst not then use <unk> in my <unk> .
And yet thou wilt , for I being <unk> in thee , <unk> am thine and all that is in me .
<unk> So now I have <unk> that he is thine , And I my self am <unk> to thy will , My self I ’ ll forfeit , so that other mine , Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still : But thou wilt not , nor he will not be free , For thou art <unk> , and he is kind , He learned but <unk> to write for me , Under that bond that him as <unk> doth bind .
The <unk> of thy beauty thou wilt take , Thou <unk> that put ’ st forth all to use , And sue a friend , came <unk> for my sake , So him I lose through my unkind abuse .
Him have I lost , thou hast both him and me , He pays the whole , and yet am I not free .
<unk> <unk> hath her wish , thou hast thy will , And Will to boot , and Will in <unk> , More than enough am I that vex thee still , To thy sweet will making addition thus .
Wilt thou whose will is large and <unk> , Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine ?
Shall will in others seem right gracious , And in my will no fair <unk> shine ?
The sea all water , yet <unk> rain still , And in <unk> <unk> to his store , So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more .
Let no unkind , no fair <unk> kill , Think all but one , and me in that one Will .
<unk> If thy soul check thee that I come so near , Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will , And will thy soul knows is <unk> there , Thus far for love , my <unk> sweet <unk> .
