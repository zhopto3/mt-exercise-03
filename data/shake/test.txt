Will will <unk> the treasure of thy love , Ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one , In things of great receipt with case we prove , Among a number one is <unk> none .
Then in the number let me pass <unk> , Though in thy store ’ s account I one must be , For nothing hold me , so it please thee hold , That nothing me , a something sweet to thee .
Make but my name thy love , and love that still , And then thou lov ’ st me for my name is Will .
<unk> Thou blind fool Love , what dost thou to mine eyes , That they behold and see not what they see ?
They know what beauty is , see where it lies , Yet what the best is , take the worst to be .
If eyes corrupt by <unk> looks , Be <unk> in the bay where all men ride , Why of eyes ’ falsehood hast thou <unk> <unk> , Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied ?
Why should my heart think that a several plot , Which my heart knows the wide world ’ s common place ?
Or mine eyes seeing this , say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face ?
In things right true my heart and eyes have <unk> , And to this false plague are they now <unk> .
<unk> When my love swears that she is made of truth , I do believe her though I know she lies , That she might think me some <unk> youth , <unk> in the world ’ s false <unk> .
Thus <unk> thinking that she thinks me young , Although she knows my days are past the best , <unk> I credit her <unk> tongue , On both sides thus is simple truth <unk> : But wherefore says she not she is unjust ?
And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
O love ’ s best habit is in seeming trust , And age in love , loves not to have years told .
Therefore I lie with her , and she with me , And in our faults by lies we <unk> be .
<unk> O call not me to <unk> the wrong , That thy unkindness lays upon my heart , <unk> me not with thine eye but with thy tongue , Use power with power , and slay me not by art , Tell me thou lov ’ st <unk> ; but in my sight , Dear heart forbear to <unk> thine eye aside , What need ’ st thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my o ’ <unk> defence can bide ?
Let me excuse thee , ah my love well knows , Her pretty looks have been mine enemies , And therefore from my face she turns my foes , That they <unk> might <unk> their injuries : Yet do not so , but since I am near slain , Kill me <unk> with looks , and rid my pain .
<unk> Be wise as thou art cruel , do not press My <unk> patience with too much disdain : Lest sorrow lend me words and words express , The manner of my <unk> pain .
If I might teach thee wit better it were , Though not to love , yet love to tell me so , As <unk> sick men when their deaths be near , No news but health from their <unk> know .
For if I should despair I should grow mad , And in my madness might speak ill of thee , Now this <unk> world is grown so bad , <unk> <unk> by mad ears <unk> be .
That I may not be so , nor thou <unk> , Bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide .
<unk> In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes , For they in thee a thousand <unk> note , But ’ tis my heart that loves what they despise , Who in despite of view is pleased to dote .
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue ’ s tune <unk> , Nor tender feeling to base touches <unk> , Nor taste , nor smell , desire to be <unk> To any <unk> feast with thee alone : But my five wits , nor my five senses can <unk> one foolish heart from <unk> thee , Who leaves <unk> the likeness of a man , Thy proud heart ’ s slave and vassal wretch to be : Only my plague thus far I count my gain , That she that makes me sin , <unk> me pain .
<unk> Love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate , <unk> of my sin , <unk> on <unk> loving , O but with mine , compare thou thine own state , And thou shalt find it <unk> not <unk> , Or if it do , not from those lips of thine , That have <unk> their <unk> <unk> , And <unk> false bonds of love as oft as mine , <unk> others ’ beds ’ <unk> of their <unk> .
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov ’ st those , Whom thine eyes woo as mine <unk> thee , <unk> pity in thy heart that when it grows , Thy pity may deserve to pitied be .
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide , By <unk> mayst thou be denied .
<unk> Lo as a careful <unk> runs to catch , One of her <unk> creatures broke away , <unk> down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay : Whilst her <unk> child holds her in chase , <unk> to catch her whose busy care is bent , To follow that which flies before her face : Not <unk> her poor infant ’ s discontent ; So run ’ st thou after that which flies from thee , Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind , But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me : And play the mother ’ s part , kiss me , be kind .
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will , If thou turn back and my loud crying still .
<unk> Two loves I have of comfort and despair , Which like two spirits do <unk> me still , The better angel is a man right fair : The worser spirit a woman <unk> ill . To win me soon to hell my female evil , <unk> my better angel from my side , And would corrupt my saint to be a devil : <unk> his <unk> with her foul pride .
And whether that my angel be turned fiend , <unk> I may , yet not directly tell , But being both from me both to each friend , I guess one angel in another ’ s hell .
Yet this shall I ne ’ er know but live in doubt , Till my bad angel fire my good one out .
<unk> Those lips that Love ’ s own hand did make , <unk> forth the sound that said ‘ I hate ’ , To me that <unk> for her sake : But when she saw my woeful state , <unk> in her heart did mercy come , <unk> that tongue that ever sweet , Was used in giving gentle doom : And taught it thus <unk> to greet : ‘ I hate ’ she <unk> with an end , That followed it as gentle day , Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is <unk> away .
‘ I hate ’ , from hate away she threw , And saved my life saying ‘ not you ’ .
<unk> Poor soul the <unk> of my <unk> earth , My <unk> earth these rebel powers array , Why dost thou pine within and suffer <unk> <unk> thy outward walls so <unk> <unk> ?
Why so large cost having so short a <unk> , Dost thou upon thy <unk> <unk> spend ?
Shall worms <unk> of this excess <unk> up thy charge ?
is this thy body ’ s end ?
Then soul live thou upon thy servant ’ s loss , And let that pine to <unk> thy store ; <unk> terms divine in <unk> hours of <unk> ; Within be fed , without be rich no more , So shall thou feed on death , that feeds on men , And death once dead , there ’ s no more dying then .
<unk> My love is as a fever longing still , For that which longer <unk> the disease , <unk> on that which doth preserve the ill , Th ’ <unk> sickly appetite to please : My reason the physician to my love , <unk> that his <unk> are not kept Hath left me , and I desperate now approve , <unk> is death , which physic did except .
<unk> cure I am , now reason is past care , And <unk> with evermore <unk> , My thoughts and my discourse as mad men ’ s are , At <unk> from the truth <unk> <unk> .
For I have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright , Who art as black as hell , as dark as night .
<unk> O me !
what eyes hath love put in my head , Which have no <unk> with true sight , Or if they have , where is my judgment fled , That <unk> falsely what they see <unk> ?
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote , What means the world to say it is not so ?
If it be not , then love doth well <unk> , Love ’ s eye is not so true as all men ’ s : no , How can it ?
O how can love ’ s eye be true , That is so <unk> with <unk> and with tears ?
No marvel then though I mistake my view , The sun it self sees not , till heaven <unk> .
O cunning love , with tears thou keep ’ st me blind , Lest eyes <unk> thy foul faults should find .
<unk> Canst thou O cruel , say I love thee not , When I against my self with thee <unk> ?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self , <unk> , for thy sake ?
Who <unk> thee that I do call my friend , On whom frown ’ st thou that I do fawn upon , Nay if thou <unk> ’ st on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan ?
What merit do I in my self respect , That is so proud thy service to despise , When all my best doth worship thy defect , <unk> by the motion of thine eyes ?
But love hate on for now I know thy mind , Those that can see thou lov ’ st , and I am blind .
<unk> O from what power hast thou this powerful might , With <unk> my heart to sway , To make me give the lie to my true sight , And swear that <unk> doth not grace the day ?
Whence hast thou this <unk> of things ill , That in the very refuse of thy deeds , There is such strength and <unk> of skill , That in my mind thy worst all best <unk> ?
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more , The more I hear and see just cause of hate ?
O though I love what others do abhor , With others thou shouldst not abhor my state .
If thy <unk> <unk> love in me , More worthy I to be beloved of thee .
<unk> Love is too young to know what conscience is , Yet who knows not conscience is born of love ?
Then gentle <unk> urge not my amiss , Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove .
For thou <unk> me , I do betray My nobler part to my gross body ’ s treason , My soul doth tell my body that he may , <unk> in love , flesh stays no farther reason , But rising at thy name doth point out thee , As his <unk> prize , proud of this pride , He is contented thy poor <unk> to be , To stand in thy affairs , fall by thy side .
No want of conscience hold it that I call , Her love , for whose dear love I rise and fall .
<unk> In loving thee thou know ’ st I am forsworn , But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing , In act thy <unk> broke and new faith torn , In <unk> new hate after new love bearing : But why of two oaths ’ breach do I accuse thee , When I break twenty ?
I am <unk> most , For all my vows are oaths but to <unk> thee : And all my honest faith in thee is lost .
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness : <unk> of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy , And to <unk> thee gave eyes to <unk> , Or made them swear against the thing they see .
For I have sworn thee fair : more <unk> I , To swear against the truth so foul a lie .
<unk> Cupid laid by his <unk> and fell asleep , A maid of Dian ’ s this advantage found , And his <unk> fire did quickly steep In a cold <unk> of that ground : Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love , A <unk> <unk> heat still to endure , And grew a <unk> <unk> which yet men prove , Against strange <unk> a sovereign cure : But at my mistress ’ eye Love ’ s <unk> <unk> , The boy for trial needs would touch my breast , I sick withal the help of <unk> desired , And thither <unk> a sad <unk> guest .
But found no cure , the <unk> for my help lies , Where Cupid got new fire ; my mistress ’ eyes .
<unk> The little <unk> lying once asleep , <unk> by his side his <unk> <unk> , Whilst many <unk> that <unk> chaste life to keep , Came <unk> by , but in her maiden hand , The fairest <unk> took up that fire , Which many legions of true hearts had <unk> , And so the general of hot desire , Was sleeping by a virgin hand <unk> .
This <unk> she <unk> in a cool well by , Which from Love ’ s fire took heat perpetual , <unk> a <unk> and <unk> remedy , For men <unk> ; but I , my mistress ’ <unk> , Came there for cure and this by that I prove , Love ’ s fire <unk> water , water <unk> not love .

ACT I SCENE I. Rossillon .
A room in the Countess ’ s palace .
Enter Bertram , the Countess of Rossillon , Helena , and Lafew , all in black .
COUNTESS .
In <unk> my son from me , I bury a second husband .
BERTRAM .
And I in going , madam , weep o ’ er my father ’ s death <unk> ; but I must attend his majesty ’ s command , to whom I am now in ward , evermore in <unk> .
LAFEW .
You shall find of the king a husband , madam ; you , sir , a father .
He that so <unk> is at all times good , must of necessity hold his virtue to you , whose worthiness would stir it up where it <unk> , rather than lack it where there is such <unk> .
COUNTESS .
What hope is there of his majesty ’ s <unk> ?
LAFEW .
He hath <unk> ’ d his <unk> , madam ; under whose <unk> he hath <unk> time with hope , and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time .
COUNTESS .
This young gentlewoman had a father — O that “ had ! ” , how sad a passage ’ tis ! — whose skill was almost as great as his honesty ; had it stretch ’ d so far , would have made nature immortal , and death should have play for lack of work .
Would for the king ’ s sake he were living !
I think it would be the death of the king ’ s disease .
LAFEW .
How called you the man you speak of , madam ?
COUNTESS .
He was famous , sir , in his profession , and it was his great right to be so : <unk> de <unk> .
LAFEW .
He was excellent indeed , madam ; the king very lately spoke of him <unk> , and <unk> ; he was <unk> enough to have liv ’ d still , if knowledge could be set up against mortality .
BERTRAM .
What is it , my good lord , the king <unk> of ?
LAFEW .
A <unk> , my lord .
BERTRAM .
I heard not of it before .
LAFEW .
I would it were not <unk> .
Was this gentlewoman the daughter of <unk> de <unk> ?
COUNTESS .
His sole child , my lord , and <unk> to my <unk> .
I have those hopes of her good that her <unk> promises her <unk> she <unk> , which makes fair gifts fairer ; for where an <unk> mind carries virtuous qualities , there <unk> go with pity , they are virtues and traitors too .
In her they are the better for their <unk> ; she <unk> her honesty , and <unk> her goodness .
LAFEW .
Your <unk> , madam , get from her tears .
COUNTESS .
’ Tis the best <unk> a maiden can season her praise in .
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all <unk> from her cheek .
No more of this , Helena ; go to , no more , lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have .
HELENA .
I do affect a sorrow indeed , but I have it too .
LAFEW .
<unk> <unk> is the right of the dead ; <unk> grief the enemy to the living .
COUNTESS .
If the living be enemy to the grief , the excess makes it soon mortal .
BERTRAM .
Madam , I desire your holy wishes .
LAFEW .
How understand we that ?
COUNTESS .
Be thou blest , Bertram , and succeed thy father In manners , as in shape !
Thy blood and virtue <unk> for empire in thee , and thy goodness <unk> with thy <unk> !
Love all , trust a few , Do wrong to none .
Be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use ; and keep thy friend Under thy own life ’ s key .
Be check ’ d for silence , But never tax ’ d for speech .
What heaven more will , That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down , Fall on thy head !
Farewell .
My lord , ’ Tis an <unk> ’ d courtier ; good my lord , <unk> him .
LAFEW .
He cannot want the best That shall attend his love .
COUNTESS .
Heaven bless him !
Farewell , Bertram .
&#91; _ Exit Countess . _ &#93; BERTRAM .
The best wishes that can be <unk> ’ d in your thoughts be servants to you !
&#91; _ To Helena . _ &#93; Be <unk> to my mother , your mistress , and make much of her .
LAFEW .
Farewell , pretty lady , you must hold the credit of your father .
&#91; _ Exeunt Bertram and Lafew . _ &#93; HELENA .
O , were that all !
I think not on my father , And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him .
What was he like ?
I have forgot him ; my imagination <unk> no favour in ’ t but Bertram ’ s .
I am undone : there is no living , none , If Bertram be away .
’ Twere all one That I should love a bright particular star , And think to wed it , he is so above me .
In his bright <unk> and <unk> light Must I be <unk> , not in his <unk> .
Th ’ ambition in my love thus <unk> itself : The <unk> that would be <unk> by the lion Must die for love .
’ Twas pretty , though a plague , To see him every hour ; to sit and draw His <unk> brows , his <unk> eye , his <unk> , In our heart ’ s table , — heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour .
But now he ’ s gone , and my <unk> fancy Must <unk> his <unk> .
Who comes here ?
Enter Parolles .
One that goes with him : I love him for his sake , And yet I know him a <unk> <unk> , Think him a great way fool , <unk> a coward ; Yet these fix ’ d evils sit so fit in him That they take place when virtue ’ s <unk> bones <unk> <unk> i ’ th ’ cold wind : withal , full oft we see <unk> wisdom <unk> on superfluous folly .
PAROLLES .
Save you , fair queen !
HELENA .
And you , monarch !
PAROLLES .
No .
HELENA .
And no .
PAROLLES .
Are you <unk> on virginity ?
HELENA .
Ay .
You have some stain of soldier in you ; let me ask you a question .
Man is enemy to virginity ; how may we <unk> it against him ?
PAROLLES .
Keep him out .
HELENA .
But he <unk> ; and our virginity , though valiant , in the defence , yet is weak .
<unk> to us some warlike <unk> .
PAROLLES .
There is none .
Man setting down before you will <unk> you and blow you up .
HELENA .
Bless our poor virginity from <unk> and <unk> !
Is there no <unk> policy how <unk> might blow up men ?
PAROLLES .
<unk> being blown down , man will <unk> be blown up ; marry , in <unk> him down again , with the breach yourselves made , you lose your city .
It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity .
<unk> of virginity is <unk> increase , and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost .
That you were made of is metal to make <unk> .
<unk> , by being once lost , may be ten times found ; by being ever kept , it is ever lost .
’ Tis too cold a companion .
Away with it !
HELENA .
I will stand for ’ t a little , though therefore I die a virgin .
PAROLLES .
There ’ s little can be said in ’ t ; ’ tis against the rule of nature .
To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers ; which is most <unk> <unk> .
He that hangs himself is a virgin : virginity murders itself , and should be buried in <unk> out of all <unk> limit , as a desperate <unk> against nature .
<unk> breeds <unk> , much like a <unk> ; <unk> itself to the very <unk> , and so dies with feeding his own stomach .
Besides , virginity is peevish , proud , idle , made of <unk> , which is the most <unk> sin in the <unk> .
Keep it not ; you cannot choose but lose by ’ t .
Out with ’ t !
Within the year it will make itself two , which is a goodly increase , and the <unk> itself not much the worse .
Away with it !
HELENA .
How might one do , sir , to lose it to her own liking ?
PAROLLES .
Let me see .
Marry , ill , to like him that ne ’ er it likes .
’ Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying ; the longer kept , the less worth .
<unk> with ’ t while ’ tis <unk> ; answer the time of request .
<unk> , like an old courtier , wears her cap out of fashion , <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , just like the <unk> and the <unk> , which wear not now .
Your date is better in your <unk> and your <unk> than in your cheek .
And your virginity , your old virginity , is like one of our French wither ’ d <unk> ; it looks ill , it eats <unk> ; marry , ’ tis a wither ’ d <unk> ; it was <unk> better ; marry , yet ’ tis a wither ’ d <unk> .
Will you anything with it ?
HELENA .
Not my virginity yet .
There shall your master have a thousand loves , A mother , and a mistress , and a friend , A <unk> , captain , and an enemy , A guide , a goddess , and a sovereign , A counsellor , a <unk> , and a dear : His humble ambition , proud humility , His <unk> <unk> , and his discord <unk> , His faith , his sweet <unk> ; with a world Of pretty , fond , <unk> <unk> That <unk> Cupid <unk> .
Now shall he — I know not what he shall .
God send him well !
The court ’ s a <unk> ; and he is one .
PAROLLES .
What one , i ’ faith ?
HELENA .
That I wish well .
’ Tis pity — PAROLLES .
What ’ s pity ?
HELENA .
That <unk> well had not a body in ’ t Which might be felt , that we , the <unk> born , Whose <unk> stars do shut us up in wishes , Might with effects of them follow our friends , And show what we alone must think , which never <unk> us thanks .

If I can remember thee , I will think of thee at court .
HELENA .
Monsieur Parolles , you were born under a charitable star .
PAROLLES .
Under Mars , I. HELENA .
I especially think , under Mars .
PAROLLES .
Why under Mars ?
HELENA .
The wars hath so kept you under , that you must needs be born under Mars .
PAROLLES .
When he was <unk> .
HELENA .
When he was <unk> , I think rather .
PAROLLES .
Why think you so ?
HELENA .
You go so much backward when you fight .
PAROLLES .
That ’ s for advantage .
HELENA .
So is running away , when fear <unk> the safety : but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing , and I like the wear well .
PAROLLES .
I am so full of business I cannot answer thee <unk> .
I will return perfect courtier ; in the which my <unk> shall serve to <unk> thee , so thou wilt be capable of a courtier ’ s counsel , and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee ; else thou diest in thine <unk> , and thine ignorance makes thee away .
Farewell .
When thou hast leisure , say thy prayers ; when thou hast none , remember thy friends .
Get thee a good husband , and use him as he uses thee .
So , farewell .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; HELENA .
Our <unk> oft in ourselves do lie , Which we <unk> to heaven : the <unk> sky Gives us free scope ; only doth backward pull Our slow <unk> when we ourselves are dull .
What power is it which <unk> my love so high , That makes me see , and cannot feed mine eye ?
The <unk> space in fortune nature brings To join like likes , and kiss like native things .
<unk> be strange <unk> to those That weigh their pains in sense , and do suppose What hath been cannot be .
Who ever <unk> To show her merit that did miss her love ?

KING .
The <unk> and <unk> are by th ’ ears ; Have fought with equal fortune , and continue A <unk> war .
FIRST LORD .
So ’ tis reported , sir .
KING .
Nay , ’ tis most <unk> , we here receive it , A <unk> , vouch ’ d from our cousin <unk> , With <unk> , that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid ; wherein our dearest friend <unk> the business , and would seem To have us make <unk> .
FIRST LORD .
His love and wisdom , <unk> ’ d so to your majesty , may plead For <unk> <unk> .
KING .
He hath arm ’ d our answer , And Florence is denied before he comes : Yet , for our gentlemen that mean to see The <unk> service , freely have they leave To stand on either part .
SECOND LORD .
It well may serve A <unk> to our gentry , who are sick For breathing and exploit .
KING .
What ’ s he comes here ?
Enter Bertram , Lafew and Parolles .
FIRST LORD .
It is the Count Rossillon , my good lord , Young Bertram .
KING .
Youth , thou bear ’ st thy father ’ s face ; <unk> nature , rather curious than in haste , Hath well <unk> ’ d thee .
Thy father ’ s moral parts <unk> thou inherit too !
Welcome to Paris .
BERTRAM .
My thanks and duty are your majesty ’ s .
KING .
I would I had that <unk> <unk> now , As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our <unk> .
He did look far Into the service of the time , and was <unk> of the <unk> .
He <unk> long , But on us both did <unk> age steal on , And wore us out of act .
It much <unk> me To talk of your good father ; in his youth He had the wit which I can well observe <unk> in our young lords ; but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them <unk> Ere they can hide their <unk> in honour So like a courtier , contempt nor <unk> Were in his pride or <unk> ; if they were , His equal had <unk> ’ d them , and his honour , <unk> to itself , knew the true minute when <unk> bid him speak , and at this time His tongue obey ’ d his hand .
Who were below him He us ’ d as creatures of another place , And bow ’ d his <unk> top to their low ranks , Making them proud of his humility , In their poor praise he <unk> .
Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times ; Which , followed well , would <unk> them now But <unk> backward .
BERTRAM .
His good remembrance , sir , Lies <unk> in your thoughts than on his tomb ; So in <unk> lives not his <unk> As in your royal speech .
KING .
Would I were with him !
He would always say , — Methinks I hear him now ; his <unk> words He <unk> ’ d not in ears , but <unk> them To grow there and to bear , — “ Let me not live , ” This his good melancholy oft began On the <unk> and heel of pastime , When it was out , — “ Let me not live ” quoth he , “ After my flame lacks <unk> , to be the <unk> Of younger spirits , whose <unk> senses All but new things disdain ; whose <unk> are <unk> fathers of their garments ; whose <unk> <unk> before their <unk> . ” This he wish ’ d .
I , after him , do after him wish too , Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home , I quickly were <unk> from my <unk> To give some <unk> room .
SECOND LORD .
You ’ re lov ’ d , sir ; They that least lend it you shall lack you first .
KING .
I fill a place , I know ’ t .
How long is ’ t , Count , Since the physician at your father ’ s died ?
He was much <unk> ’ d .
BERTRAM .
Some six months since , my lord .
KING .
If he were living , I would try him yet ; — Lend me an arm ; — the rest have worn me out With several <unk> ; nature and sickness <unk> it at their leisure .
